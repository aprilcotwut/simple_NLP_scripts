perfect gift keeps them warm while traveling without being to and bulky heats up quickly to a comfortable temperature i
the cold beach in a huge pickup truck with a camper top tied this blanket with sufficient power supply but
keep her legs warm it is not bulky or too and does not get in the way of using the
blanket lacks is a manual temperature adjustment it not that of a deal though if you are still trying to
an lap robe just right for traveling but not too or bulky seemed to heat well overall i very happy
is that is rattles a lot but its not a deal i do think the chinese are using the same
moment there was a storm that hit north california not enough to close the resort but enough to freeze up

there was going to be welding involved easy welds no deal just be aware kit went on easy and looked
to incidents that children can understand and appreciate nice and lots of stories and illustrations has the pocket library too
around liked to see every one happy it is too a thing to explain to a small rabbit but humans
why those changes were made to get it on the screen it was pretty good kind of slow seemed to
is where it failed to capture me in the end on circus history lacking on the love story not one
movie ever could for instance the owner of the circus al is shown in the movie in only one scene
sit on the edge of your seat tale of the top preserved from the in the mind of jacob peanuts
true love deceit greed and stardom only possible under the top i hate the circus because i do believe in
story the fun glory and despair of life under the tent are detailed the despair of aging in the nursing
fun read for summer in water for elephants the circus top is highlighted by author sara gruen at the ending
descriptions and depth of detail takes me away to the tops good book really enjoyed it easy reading g and
and to be able to see it brought to the screen this is a story that any who loves animals
to see if you misread it but no not a deal but it interrupted the flow bad enough but the
the train depot and to a farmer field where the top would suddenly sprout with flags the story is told
forgotten the circus comes to town and sets up its top tents across the street jacob comes alive and through
one can see the sawdust in the air as the top was put up one can see the cotton candy
depression this is the story of the spectacle of the top it will put both its hands around the heart
i recall was what books about circuses this got a laugh from the audience most of whom had read water
out a difficult living in a world of rejection the boss pushes on to maintain that his world is composed
challenge the stability of the circus for example there is al who runs the circus with a nearly ruthless practicality
through the night to the next town and the next show somehow sara gruen managed to make a thriller out
want a story with adventure romance and excitement under the top this was an interesting book from a number of
treat a quick read it reminded me of the movie fish gruen sets the characters up with quirks and expected
circus sara gruen makes us feel the excitement of the top the pain sadness and joy of the people in
love the romance element although seems to sum up a part of the story even bigger than the circus is
this was it the figure of a man entering a top from the side flap only to see a figure
storytelling anyone who ever dreamed of running away to the top or just dreamed of running away should read this
be reckoned with there is also walter kinko the clown al camel and of course rosie the elephant the ending
i read on i must say this book made a impression upon me as far as a story of adventure
on his while looking at the graphic magazine it a disappointment because the story is actually interesting and i want
kept thinking this would have been handled by having either al or one of his managers travel alone and make
town it is so close to the facility that the tent and other goings on can be observed from the
and during the stampede all these animals were in the tent at the same time without handlers why would rosie
is hard but living life under the famous benzini brothers top is even harder despite elderly jacob being extremely and
it certainly made me remember my first visit to the top as a youngster in the late i would absolutely
traveling entertainers not even the same type of traveling groups regret is not finishing the book before they announced the
takes place a man head is split open by a stake the next chapter is in the nursing home where
i found it depressing and the whole thing just one sad story one thing it changed was i will not
downtrodden animals the sleazy side shows the glamour of the top are matched only by her honest characters who are
hal to be the olde jacob character and i a fan of reese witherspoon however i do not quite agree
satisfying could easily see this one making it to the screen using the same cast of characters from the titanic
just as much as maria does this book is so and terrible and inspiring and real this book strikes a
about two of his bullfighting death in the afternoon and game hunting the green hills of africa and the novel
in spite of this one criticism i ended up with smiles on my face many times and his prowess at
mo to santa fe north to from robinson the little horn and finally deadwood quite an adventure indeed in the
buy it you ca fight it i finished rereading little man and decided to flashman and the redskins which covers
to its setting after all i have always been a aficionado of the history of the american west and i
been made into a movie i ca imagine although little man seems to have been an attempt at it the
everything worthwhile they had and continue to them by trade companies are too powerful and can manipulate governments they the
mars moon and the rest to the planet itself no deal but in my mind an inconsistency then the book
the book especially warnings about the future of society as business tries to takes control of everything sound familiar considering
give the colonization of the solar system has been a topic in science fiction for decades and yet no book
etc was confusing to me but i understand nothing about companies somebody out there probably appreciates what i could not

help save the lives of american had to read this book to the end to find in what creative way
most righteous of causes can somehow get all twisted these issues aside rest assured clark is a man worth meeting
thickens from beginning to end i ca wait for the finale as all previous ones a dance with dragons did
renewed hope at the start of each chapter that something was going to happen in that chapter judging by the
book had some twists good ones if you are a fan of the targaryens i say be prepared to know
that usually means the author is building up to some event that pulls it all together so while i did
attention span first let me state that i am a fan of the series but am very disappointed in the
the writer is taking the books if and that a if hbo decides to finish the series to the very
a reader overall in my opinion this book is a snore i hooked on this series however book can not
the characters i missed in affc at first and anticipated and possibly an explanation of any mystical elements thus far
a little with the relentless drama of little people with egos stomping all over the world and trying to lay
and fans of the series know that ned got the haircut in the first book i hoping the book will
it around with me wherever i want without lugging that heavy tome with me continuing the story with new alliances
resolved similar to what was done in feast but the overarching questions and problems were left largely in limbo until
delve into detail i will say is i am a fan of george martin i think he weaves an exciting
that your friend here is only mostly dead there a difference between mostly dead and all dead mostly dead is
need for speed the run dirt has been a very disappointment the reaction times with the controler a not responsive
at the reason that i say this is that a selling point of this software seems to be that it
are looking for but it does and its not that of a deal but for the more serious players such
lot that do love the price and i saw a change on my wii everything is more clear on the
returned the main problem is that the battery is too to fit and keeps popping out when i try to
skill and style as they explore backcountry and rewards win and you be rewarded ssx let players level up character
however i do think that they should have put a cruise ship and a yacht and a fishing boat in
bulk to the controllers which is great if you have hands they also keep the little one greasy fingers from
too small what was worse was that it was too for the bottom screen i had to use scissors to
too small what was worse was that it was too for the bottom screen i had to use scissors to
look them up the magic move actually turns into a ole that eliminates everyone in close proximity and for the
bit worried that lara was so attractive and has such assets she was great alright but the game was just
or seen cloud strife life turns out to be a joke although he said in a long and relatively boring
eventually the only disappointment was cait sith who is a loser and a lousy whoah there are so many things
mexican folklore and mayan art thrown in for fun add orange demons hot rods killer cat races and the grim
and finally fantastic weaponry sound effects is one of the plusses in this game and rightfully so fantastic is all
im serious if you dont have this your missing out check out its sequel after you bought this from my
hang on to the ledge while yet this was too of a deal i think that feature could of made
many different options i suggest proximity mines only and such levels one player is just as good it provides a
a franchise to stand up there and fight with the boys it this by avoiding the much made mistake of
a special place in your collection unless you not a fps fan then that okay too it your preference the
twice over missions of fun and excitement if yur a fan this is one of the best games in the
era the sound is moderate but sound isnt a very facter in deciding the rating of the followup on the
collection this is a kid friendly racing game many are turn offs with sexual and violent various levels and terrain
challenges you face and overcome the music that playes a role in the game the use of time day and
times it was so good i highly recommend it to zelda fans note this game has a sequel called majora
to my review graphics looks really good for the time vast valleys long mountains clear water beautiful guts of sound
and are usefull the whole way through one of the mechanics is of course the ocarina itself you play it
of zelda ocarina of time official strategy guide it a help to me and you if you with revealed to
episode i had the same amount of coverage being a fan of both of course i beat the game and
dont know but anyways in this one you could be link and little link not like in majoros mask where
bow so the fairy tells you to go to the tree who makes you go inside him and kill the
tree who makes you go inside him and kill the spider that in there then he gives you a rock
played by every nintendo fan and fans who are not on nintendo the zelda series is infact a big popular
not big on nintendo the zelda series is infact a popular series but this one all of them ocarina of
great i really love this game but the only really problem with this game is that it has this one
to use these moves even when you are fighting a boss or even fighting at all the dungeons are cleverly
is very tough and takes practice and patience capture all poes roaming the field of hyrule and sell them to
know what path to take because the levels are so turok seeds of evil has a lot to love about
do need to watch their locations game though i a fan of the tomb raider series and this game is
the star wars timeline that we never saw on the screen the graphics and game play are good and the
not a fan of the anyways this game was a step up from the super nintendo and sega genesis generation
same stages over and over with no payoff but one headache now let talk about the camera throughout most of
the are required to face bowser this game is really too you can fly turn invisible and go through certain
much more you get to battle boss enemies such as bomb big whomp big boo wiggler and of course bowser
to see where you are going it is not a deal but it is frustrating sometimes when i need to
aside from the camera angle issue but it not that of a deal to give this game any lower then
easy or hard like if you want to make a city it takes time and it hard but if you
to them and these fat ladies who stand by these pots and whip you if you get too close to
it is still a fun game and if you a resident evil fan i would buy it if you just
that it did not come with the booklet its no deal i guess but it seems like that type of
he loved this game since it released i got a grin from him about it i did buy the game
kill the game on same as the it not a deal but for now it helps him to learn to
it over and over again i love blowing demons up time if you are the movie doom fan and think
to just make that turn and when you get some air it feels like the rider is actually flying through
came out originally before online was any kind of a soul calibur i can use taki and seung mina later
in orienting myself seemingly useless items like the green and on level make good landmarks once you learn the layout
it he gotten back into the swing of things a plus is that this game can be played on our
title this game is vast the world map is overly but the sheer depth of it is astonishing connecting caves
not even a fan of rpg i still not a fan of them you owe it to yourself to pick
like knuckles gliding and climbing abilities as well as sonic no longer fishes like he did in sonic adventure and
by sonic team is very unique but with team rose the cat can attack on his own cream the rabbit
speed rose amy rose speed cream and cheese flight and power my boys love this game and play it often
want a challenge i suggest trying team chaotix i adore but amy is kind of stupid the way she over
this game it is the best game it is one smash trust me you are going to like it so
the camera is in the game is worth the money time remember when you first got your nintendo entertainment system
original bit format one thing about the screen its not enough to get the entire game inside it so they
and legend of zelda spirit tracks if you are a fan of nintendo buy this game if you are not
player and make them either skinny as a or as as the can make the ball go a certain amount
glitches and eventually make your copy nothing more than a jumbled blob of stuff that does make any sense be
my dream come true since i have always been a superman fan first off allow me to take a deep
are incredibly beautiful that range from simple character intros to plot points the animation seems so colorful and vibrant rather
a memorable experience if you areas in this game are good looking and fun to work your way through your
or hear if you dont you may be missing a part of the game i recomend a notebook to keep
realistic you almost feel like you there of course the pain is this game consisted of discs which you have
some exercise only get this game if you are a myst fan and you have a lot of patience it
the game has amazing multiplayer if you are a really multiplayer fan and would like to play a game that
resistance group called avalanche why these groups and names have capital letters for seemingly no reason is beyond me seeing
chips couple of drinks and a bed and definately a screen tv with and plan to be there for your
hours to an outdated rpg i mean there is a jump in visual graphics from to that is very obvious
course action the storyline expands from a rebellion against a corporation shinra that is sucking the life out of the
chasing the big bad while avoiding or fighting the other bad and unraveling the and there this really weird scene
to clear that up and make it less of a deal the magic money and experience system is very easy
game ever made the grafix looks really bad sorta like of oranges with eyes cloud the main hero has a
game does little to develop them beyond a certain no incentive to use one character over may very well be
try that or the gold saucer which is like a all negative reviews about this game they do know what
grow on me when we introduced to him he a cat and one of the shinra scientist hojo project at
turning the only huge city on gaia midgar into one industrial market they are putting up mako reactors that suck
there are a couple of to the easiness though one monster which i killed even though it was not necessary
the graphics are bad and the story line works pretty problem i have with the game is the play control
with this version and with allmost characters to master a bag full of gameplay modes a mission battle mode to
fun facter sucks i bought the game and it a rip off you are better off buying wwf raw or
was basically just solving puzzles fighting nemesis times and the ending given all this resident evil is still a fun
that you can make your own ammunition is also a stars excellent gameplay and fun factor overall as i stated
hell upon the zombie menace also the replay value is as you get costume changes in the boutique outside of
but not the least these very very strong and very bigger than a raptor anyways but way smaller than the
street fighter alpha style instead of the neogeo pocket quot head quot mode the backgrounds are equally nice with just
really go through levels because the whole game is one level with small loading screens but you backtrack whenever you
best as they are chocked full of your character victims fun if you like big or causing lots of destruction
into what they thought was a excellent alternative to the dollar console because of this i personally will not buy
the past years it gives me something i love it i have big hands like maybe most people out there
to my year daughter and she loves it were a game family if you do buy a dreamcast they are
play them in bits so if you one of those jerks who hate sega because of previous systems and would
huge launch that not only killed the dreamcast but a boast with it dvd playback feature and i feel that
this is a great feature but it really not that of a deal will cost about more than dreamcast and
that the dreamcast was on its way to become something but all isnt lost maybe the dreamcast paved the way
dreamcast thanx for your time or dreamcast either one the thing that people are missing in this argument is the
the nintendo ds over the sony psp this year and stores like gamestop and target are only advertising the nintendo
all very satisfying music is very well executed i a fan of game music and i have certainly been impressed
that there is absolutley no way to get a mustang problem they only give you money in to buy the
fighters and start coming after you see and you thought companies just did care about the little people only place
see there are more pros than cons but the one con the incompatibility with xp brings it rating down for
you get to fight a mixture of baddies theres a online contingent of players out there unreal tournement and team
game there were first off the main tails knuckles amy and gamma complete all them to get super sonic no
game is either extremely easy or it is annoying like is the game can be flown through the only thing
tails prower amy rose sonic love interest knuckles the echidna the cat and gamma one of eggman robots you must
tails knuckles and amy with new roles such as and the cat or biggums as i like to call him
creator of the supreme hedgehog franchise the only person is the fat the niggling fishing game must be removed it
her sonic cd debut with abilities that require her hammer the cat has nothing interesting except for there gamma dr
and the seventh aboard the tornado ii which crashed after used it to escape the egg carrier with all the
time with upgrades he can shoot more targets and fly has nothing special but fishing even with upgrades he can
a out of out of golden game i not as a sonic fan as i was in the past but
or popper and attract and hook one out of several fish this is great during the later levels and if
for a second player to call this is actually a problem that why it gets stars instead of this game
tragedy is that it was maintained and updated i not on games and i do like the mtg online pricing
quot shandalar quot world everything moves way too fast no deal just find a cpu reducer utility on the internet
little difficult like in the zone there a level called boulder ally rediculously difficult how are you supposed to tell
feet long the orginal snes controllers are foot it a difference it works i was so excited it arrived quickly
great i read other reviews that said they have a delay when using them if there is then it might
over the average scrabble participant here however in that the m maven always knows those big long words that you
have total control of your environment and you can build and i mean big the levels are well laid out
program disc it does have all the features of those sticks you see out there but it has everything you
so if you wondering why goldeneye wo play on your screen it because you need an older tv and if
moving sw gaming in a good direction there are some problems with it but if you looking for some good
to conquer a planet i built a huge fleet destroyers ol mon cal cruisers and i attacked the thing was
is when this game first came out it was a change for me from what i was playing mario brothers
do get me wrong warcraft was great also i a science fiction fan this game will keep ya playing for
go wrong by picking up a copy i a pretty video game fan i usually get the hit games kind
that i had more time to play it i a fan of you do know jack so i got this
