i needed a set of jumper cables for my new and these had good reviews and were at a good
but a lot of times you will be beside another or ca get really close because of this i would
very happy i bought this and kept it in my had to use it several times on my own car
it several times on my own car and a friends i bought an extra set for my girlfriend these are
not work we borrowed a set of cables and the started right up i inspected the cables and they seem
a lot of guys ask where i got my brothers had been having some battery problems so i bought this
i rate these cables star a if you have a i was able to help someone at the store one
needing to use them to jump the battery in my sure you get what you pay reading all the reviews
at all you should do so very carefully jumping a battery is quite simple but easy to screw up and
nice when you can not get right next to the that needs a jump gauge is great for this length
the longest cable possible is a major plus if your is parked up against something like a pole or wall
or even parked on a one way street the booster the car a dead battery can pull in close enough
parked on a one way street the booster car the a dead battery can pull in close enough to use
position to be jumped if your diving a normal sized they can even pull in behind you to jump you
low voltage need heavier gauge wire load amperage it a starter so it takes a lot of power the voltage
last connection make is the neg clamp to the dead on a frame ground something metal and not moving or
charge on the dead battery then attempt to start the as soon as it starts remove the cables starting with
them no dead batteries yet my wife bought a new and i created an emergency car kit for her including
wife bought a new car and i created an emergency kit for her including this cable i ordered the gauge
hyundai months later dome light left on and pulled up expedition once hooked up all power was restored to hyundai
me a old pair of cheap cables that started the instantaneously were the really gauge or perhaps manufacturing defect where
does not finally cables long enough to go from the sometimes you can not get that close and these are
to preventive emergency always buy the best with each new i make sure i have a quality booster cable in
to cedar point last weekend and going back my friend battery died i immediately pulled up next to his car
car battery died i immediately pulled up next to his side to side and was able to jump start his
side to side and was able to jump start his using this feet cable i now was able to verify
are good for jumping that big truck battery or small battery they work very good and are some what compact
had stored them inside i hooked them up and the started i had been using a good set from sears
long booster cable since in case i ended up my needed to be jumped and it times already in like
can reach far enough regardless of the position of my the times my car run out battery the car is
will start your car in cold weather usually a new battery has cold crank cca since these cables are made
engine block ground point to my honda civic mid size use cca battery so my assumption is anything has current
sure comes in handy if you ca get the second as close as possible to jump the dead battery these
either well worth the good buy for sure when my battery died we got a from someone with a big
truck guy had his own cable to use to our we bought these so that we have them and they
for quality minus one for price i have an old its bound to need these sometime i got a set
trucks even a coworker was trying to jump off a with his cheap thin chinese set and it would work
and it would work i hooked mine up and the started right up this is one of those items that
are important my husband bought these to keep in my in case my battery ran down while i was out
of town i feel secure now having them in my he says they are good quality i did own any
to use them i do worry where or how my is parked recently i had to park behind someone at
need to use them my son needed to have his started and these heavy duty booster cables were easily able
it a great investment i bought a pair for each if you have to use them parking will not be
that is long enough for most situations for my old i was very pleased to see what arrived when i
like they used to bought these to keep in the for emergencies i only needed to use them once and
on various occasions when i forgot the lights on my so i guess worth the money the length is pretty
quicker with these i use the battery in my running to charge a deep cycle battery while camping and these
at least several time every year usually on someone else i rescued a few strangers in parking lots because i
cost super heavy duty may be overkill to boost a but better overkill than having wimpy cables i really like
or if they ca carry enough power to start your you might as well have been lugging a brick in
laws against marketing products that can not jump start a worse having no cables or cables means that a criminal
a few extra feet when trying to jump start someone parked in some tight parking space so you back to
it bought them after struggling one day to jump my the car that was assisting me had plenty enough juice
cables i bought a month or so back for my they do really seem that much thicker that said they
die on me all the i finally got a new i was almost upset that it always starts by itself
cable literally melt on me once and would start the because it was too thin do use cheap jumper cables
and beefy and will do the job for any passenger or truck do go for a higher number and therefore
you will eventually have to use these to start a that is boxed in by a garage trees or other
a long time just long enough to start the boosting get out walk over to the yukon and start it
easy i would buy it again for jumping a family but not a heavy duty truck due to the size
cheap jumper cables you will be lucky to jump your if you do actually successfully jump the car with cheap
jump your car if you do actually successfully jump the with cheap thin cables it will take who knows how
take who knows how many minutes of running the other at rpms with these it was instant i will never

for the company to complain to them i test my and thought i was good to go i then rinsed
its first action i helped a neighbor jump start his my mazda to his sienna no problem really glad i
i highly recommend these booster cables bought sets for everyones then i bought the boss bag to keep them in
in you never need jumper cables if they in your i have used this yet but it looks like a
live inside the spare tire in the back of my for emergency use only it exactly what i wanted excellent
many cars to find someone with booster cables if my lost battery power battery was in process of and needing
guide for those who might not know there way around jumping procedures good price vary fast shipment product as exactly
happy with this purchase they cheap and they get my started in the job done very strong very charged many

jump start your car in a hurry or emergency my battery dies often and in the last weeks we had
would recommend i ordered these for emergency purposes in my the cable is fine but the clamps on each end
heavy duty usage good sturdy set of cables for the have held up well for a few years now of
functional jumper cables to throw in the trunk of your lacks the fancy safety heavy on the grips you will
wide mouth clamps its an ok design for a small battery but could be much better bought this as a
day the next morning we hooked it up and her started right up so do the world a favor and
like the yellow color bought these to leave in the for emergencies have had to use them they seem well
solid connections ordered for daughter as she just bought a prior to christmas she has used it yet but as
set of jumper cables with the sale of my last i was in need of new ones these are long
like a lady luck sticker on the back of the but sometimes not there always a friend who needs some
yet but i confident they will allow me to jump expected better quality from coleman cable they will work but
location that requires a longer cable and even if your has the terminals right up front the nice person offering
i bought these because everyone should have jumpers in their my car luckily died twice at home but next time
i might not be as lucky these will revamp your quick its a decent guage too great booster cables i

there no you like oil all over your garage or this is the best way i have found to get
this leads to a rather large oil pool under my i came to amazon to finally find a new one
and should be by engineers that actually change their own oil i just echo the other reviews on this product
i ever buy this product works great for draining your crankcase oil it has a screen to catch the drain
out the hard way as it leaked all inside my even after i double it that makes this product pretty
i purchased this cheap funnel for pouring oil into my engines i have a honda fit and a hyundai elantra
the cap on the spout i put it in my trunk and it leaked a substantial amount what a mess
sizes and only one of them will fit into your gas tank opening the one is for unleaded vehicles the

the perfect length because the pulled car can see your complete and can make an stop if is color is
purpose it strong and does the ended up pulling a out of a snow pile using these straps connected to
to my jimmy no problems and the owner of the was quite happy a tow strap is better than a

to go on car trips and play my in the but unlike gameboy it does run off batteries then when
you can take bigger tv instead of those small little tv and i can also play my but some of

gauge in the glove box i will go to the with the to use it on the other cars works
an outstanding way to check the tire pressure of your i own one for years and it still works i
great little gift or something good to have in your or laying around the house it was truck before buying
have a better lecture when i put air into my tires this is helpful since most of the times you

periods of time it finally melted one day in the outlet this inverter is being used primarily with a gaming

at least the i tried it the fuses in the not on the unit itself so a box of fuses
rarely heats up on trips with or people in the this has no problem running a laptop or two and
which to me is to be expected but once the is on the road i did even notice great product
highly recommend this for use of laptop charging in the after that experience i replaced the fuses in the auto

own four snow movers because i keep one in each and one at home and have a spare because i

junk head does not form around the surface of a there is a slight curve to the head that ends
allowing the outer sides to come in contact with the it does not clean crevice like the body to where
a better job i finished the job off with glove wash mitt is super fluffy that got into all the

who wants to keep their car clean between washes my sits outside in parking garages and old sheds all of
them seem to dump tons of dust on my poor this model comes with the wood handle others out there
even better if you put a sealant wax on your you find that you can pull a lot more material
that you can pull a lot more material off your the duster will easily remove pollen dust and any other
sense but it true i just bought a new black so i figured i start with a new duster ca
with a new duster ca say enough about these great dusters much better than the cheap take offs go gh
go gh gh ro gj jj gj kg k this duster is a great invention and i am so happy
be back in the game with this best idea in cleaning this is a great only have to wash my

car and makes it look like you just waxed your if you take care of it then it should last
it was a great price takes the dust off my without leaving any streaking that some report with other brands
for years plus but i never used it on my instead i always used it on the blinds works like
and much less effort this is a classic tool for buffs or other people who are ocd about their ride
about their ride by do feel like going to the wash every other day it does the trick the price
before but never one that left lint on my show this thing is terrible do not purchase works well but
like i a car guy you heard about the california duster a billion times or maybe already own one they
one they work great as advertised dust do rub your whenever you put her in the garage and she stay
better at first after a couple weeks i dust the about about four times a day it started to work
was cleaner and still worked just as you love your even half as much as i do this product is
and still keep the car looking great really the best duster out there in my opinion used others and they
weeks or months look clean you must either keep your in a garage or use a cover like i do
looking clean if i wash clay bar and wax my i can go two months or perhaps more without washing
wax and dirt also if there is condensation on the it really renders the duster ineffective so make sure it
it feel a lot more solid i have a black and this takes the dust right off great buy out
is supposed to only glide the device lightly over the yes i would buy it again and will recommend to
again and will recommend to others this is my california duster i have found that it cleans and restores a
did not keep up the appearance of his vehicle this duster is simply stunning i feel like it waxes car

are complaining about the inability to plug this into a lighter this inverter is capable of converting a great deal
i was seeking a converter that would plug into a lighter and power small items while driving the car they
a car lighter and power small items while driving the they exist they are about watts and would draw a
it must be attached with alligator clips directly to the battery terminals i was thinking about the amp drawing requirement
other is to power a vacuum cleaner for clearing the it also comes in handy for power outages but this
less frequent it a compact size that fits underneath the seats the high power cleaning use full size watt vacuum
vacuum cleaner it connects using heavy cables supplied to the battery terminals directly and the internal fan runs to keep
things cool for the laptop use it connects to the cigarette lighter using a regular volt plug unfortunately xantrex never

without complete data in the computer will result in the being rejected at least in massachusetts actron is no longer

that throws consistent check engine light cel warnings or a that has an intermittent cel you will want to have

for hooking up a similar piece of equipment to your to see what the computer tells them then they stack
reset i used this scanner to verify that the other code was significant delete the code and it has returned
off over the years it great to know how your is doing without paying someone else to do it just
up im sure it will come in handy on this model even tells you about the other engine sensors the
mode unexpectedly check engine light illuminated and stayed lit the would operate in lower gears in a strange fashion and
this to say i saved a bunch of money on repairs by having and using an actron autoscanner i purchased
top of the engine i replaced the hose and the runs like new i erase the codes again and i
today i had a check engine light problem with my i purchase the meter and it was able to determine
problem i reset the error and decided to have my evaluated professionally if the problem returned many weeks later and
in the wrong direction this is in no way the diagnostic machine but it pretty dang useful to have in
you will not get a cause you know exactly your is ready or not this autoscanner has already paid for
later the light was out i bought this because my failed mass state inspection due to emmisions sensors being not
state inspection due to emmisions sensors being not ready my was garaged for the winter and the battery drained this
obdii test returned not ready instead of just driving the and hoping the sensors were reset by the next time
were being set and ended up having to take my to the dealer for a software update first recall once
couple times works great would recommend for anyone who likes gadgets this beats having to go to the dealer or
but for someone who does occasional maintenance on his own this tool is worth the investment if you paid more
a lot of money when i needed to diagnose my issues and erase error codes great price and product that
and it helped him diagnose the problem with my son easy to set up and use instructions are straight forward
codes to turn off the light just make sure the key is in the on position but the engine is
that offered me a fee to put my brother s in their machine to diagnose a check engine light with

arrived in excellent conditions i am going to check my and i will send you a feedback to see how
a feedback to see how it have already checked my with the scanner it worked very well i am very
says i was able to pull the code from the diagnose the problem in this case replace the thermostat and
obdii reader has saved me more money and time on repairs than i would have thought lets me read and
around cars fairly well this unit will not fix your for you what it will do is send you in
had to pay for the repair now i can my and instantly know what is wrong with it before shopping
my husband to ask him if i should take the to our mechanic he told me to go home and
the actron and hooked it up i then turned the on and the air worked fine and no error codes
of mind to know what is going on with the i am going to keep it in the glove compartment
keep it in the glove compartment for future dec my was shuddering a bit at low speeds and stops i
so all i had to do was replace one coil runs like a will easily the cost of the autoscanner
even if you do end up needing to take your in at least you know what you are dealing with
away and it solved two warning light problems on his it is a handy small easy to use gadget worth
was an sensor since it was never replaced and the has miles on it and i was going to buy
in very handy i am more likely to fix the myself with the information this scanner gives i received it
and time this scanner works just great to view your every once in awhile and my friends also i glad
problem you will have is finding out where in your the plug is here is the short version of my
knowing that it would be at least to take his to the shop i purchased the actron in no time

work long story short i had the starter in my for months trying many fixes and adjustments no luck well

me the only way to operate this unit with my is to use the factory transponder to unlock the car
in the door this way before it remote starts the it will unlock the door like you put the key
from the remote start to the tachometer feed in the program the unit for tach operation then teach it to

it also did do anything on smaller dents on my it surprisingly did come with any instructions but was easy
remaining dent is noticeable unless you are close to the will probably buy a smaller dent puller to attempt to
made tool this dent puller easily attached to my sons and popped an impact dent right out it is barely
purchase i liked the construction you could probably drive a over it and it would not break my only complaint
pay for this puller worked so well someone hit my honda civic in a parking lot and did leave a
they were flexible enough to get a good took the to a local place to get an estimate they said

not going to stick i could adhere it to my door or my trunk lid but could not get it
drain if someone ever sits on the hood of my or if i ever have a large pane of glass
pulled out a creased dent from the back of a there is still a smaller dent that we could pull
a smaller dent that we could pull out but the looks much more presentable we ordered this dent puller based

up at my house two days later and fit the the cover is good for the price happy with the

in the garage because the cats jump up on the and scratch it this goes on easily is lightweight and
delivery time also well done i noticed scratches on my within two days i felt cheated and angry i wanted
wanted to avoid washing pollen and bird droppings from my but i guess i back to washing this product is
bad that no company today makes a soft inexpensive indoor cover well also too bad that amazon description is not
of the garaged cars i like the cover fit my and is easy to use light weight and if you
i clk convertible i park in an underground parking my gets very dusty very quickly so i cover it when
cover it when not in use i have another commuter i use regularly i would not want to put this
also very affordable for my budget this is a fine cover for a garaged vehicle keeps the dust off good
one exception i got the ft cover for a ft and it is very snug and wont go below the
is very snug and wont go below the bumper granted is a american made boat sedan but i thought the
excellently installed it within minutes by myself and now the is stored for the winter and this was cheaper than
the winter and this was cheaper than two king sheet is stored indoors so this will see minimal weather so
we had last week it dries off well and the stays clean i am happy with it and for the
it and for the service this is like the budge cover i bought about three years ago which i really
this new one is very difficult to put on the my old one has elastic only on the ends and
when hooking to bottom to keep it on top of because it will blow off it ripped the wholes that
then it may last months to a year bought the cover for my camaro and it fits like a glove
like a glove elastic outter so it fits snug great cover for the price and i would buy another this
after i bought it do not buy this cover my is about i made sure to order a cover thats
it but fortunately the feet and inches version fits my all right works great to keep the dirt away from

good protection tight around the bottom to fit to the fit well for my mgb falls apart less than a
it was wet and so was the top of the the cover disintegrated after only weeks in use parts of
it are in shreds and it just falling off the this is a decent cover for the price the car

the entire life of the cover was spent covering a in the garage it was only exposed to limited mostly
cover from another manufacturer i bought this cover for my and it dose not cover it so it is being

i thought for sure this cover would have protected my while i traveled unfortunately it deteriorated within a month and
home from my overseas journey the new paint on my faded plus there were outlines from tree leaves had this

the first step in cleaning any plastic surface on your that is plastic then put the polish on i highly

loan to purchase it along with the deed to my and let face it getting a boat ready for the
thirteen years old it seems to do better than regular type wax for ten bucks per bottle less than the
this for years as soon as i bought my new this was one of my first purchases for it does
service from amazon too if my cousin had done my windshield with this stuff i would have never believed it
product for years i apply it each time i my i do have to use my wiper blades as much
great product and be sure to apply it after a wash this product is amazing if you have used it
and so so easy to apply would never drive a in the rain again without it easy to put not

side windows because those obviously do have windshield heard the talk guys say that smears i have not noticed that
land on the windshield but immediately rolls off whenever the is moving leaving a very clear view through the windshield
it definitely helps make water bead and run off my windows in light rain you do even need wipers it
on their own i have it in my bucket of detailing supplies right next to my trim and my headlight
getting it repaired is not worth the cost since the itself would cost less than so i tried this product
during winters back then i had purchased my first new and decided to try after seeing a promotional display convinced
not good for shipping lying in the trunk of the etc when i use rain x on my car windshield
the car etc when i use rain x on my windshield i barely need to use my wipers during heavy

been using this to keep a battery charged in a that i rarely drive or start it can be easily
easily installed under the hood without bolting it into the and the charger is very secure the bracket for the
also convinced that fords have a damn trickle as this drains a battery faster than anything else i have seen
of electronic gadgets so they consume significant electricity even when is being driven almost every week we get no start
no start due to weak battery i have an external battery charger old it is bulky to setup to charge
one of these charger and installed in one of the that frequently dies even with new battery now i can
now i can just plug in to the wall when is parked each night and unplug in the morning before
will reduce the risk of not able to start the to almost will be buying another one for our other
is the battery charger i own boat rv and classic it keeps your battery fresh i use these chargers on
very often such as my motorhome whole house generator classic and on the tractors during the winter months this charger
good price i had a dead battery in my weekend twice so that was it battery tender time since i
auto batter chargers would buy it again or for another etc i like the short volt cord and the included
truck i have of these charges now one for each that is not driven very often they worked extremely well
batteries freezing and going bad i have over on my audio so the price of this little unit was great
need the battery when i use one for charging a battery i place the charger under the hood and loop
for a year plus now it small charges up a battery just fine even from completely dead the only thing
a small onboard battery charger to trickle charge a small king midget that does get driven enough to keep the
to start the battery was low only volt so the didnt start but with this charger tha battery was ready
charger mounted very neatly near the battery on one antique and looks like it could have been factory installed easy
short cord a foot cord would be ridiculous on a mountable charger i like to use those inch lighted extension
the boat battery while at have one to maintain wife battery while away during winter months this has performed well
is a must have if you have a weekend only i have several trickle chargers similar to this i use
up very impressive this is an excellent product for a that receives sporadic use it intended to be mounted in
receives sporadic use it intended to be mounted in the or more frequently boat but can be mounted in the
various checks and attempts including charging for over a week battery still dead since we did not give up on
to install this charger next to my battery on my we do drive this one as much a few hours
have this permanently hooked up to my car battery when sits long time i just plug it in and works
just plug it in and works perfect have for each never fails i have used this charger for many years
longer cable than my original one bought one for my about four years ago still using it so got one
has quite a high parasitic electrical load due to the alarm even with a brand new battery if i do
that i could run an extension cord over to the and plug it in order to maintain the battery between
and ready for use whenever i want to use the during the winter months i do not drive the car
car during the winter months i do not drive the at all because of the snow depth and salt on
unit i can use it for my garden tractor my my farm tractor as well as my boat it does
charge a large deep cycle rv battery and a regular battery just fine i needed this to charge my motorcycle
the battery will get at more for the infrequently used these are very convenient i have one installed on my
be permanently mounted in a vehicle such as a hobby that rarely driven or a boat or a riding lawn
years has developed an appetite for batteries somewhere in my is this little demon who could be found by at
made to mount either directly onto the chassis of the or onto this neat bracket that slips under the battery
for attaching towing lines so now i plug in my every time i come home if you do something similar
or windshield or do something to remind you that the is plugged in you do want to drive off with
a great paper weight just keep it away from your bought one of these for my utility trailer liked it
overcharged or dead batteries this charger has been maintaining my since the day i bought it i plug my car
car since the day i bought it i plug my in most every night to keep my system topped off
charge charger is also not quite enough to support the when in acc wish they had a given its limitations
manual charger can it also works ok for topping off truck and deep cycle boat batteries too if you can
worked awesome def a must have if you have a that stored or draining probs i got that fixed but
covering insulation to just plug charger in when i leave am going on my second winter using this for my
had a set of headlights in the rear of my they dont light up as well as i expected for
lights put out plenty to flood the area behind the so do have any doubts on that and yes the
around the plug at least in the outlet in my so that it is possible for the end of the
this is pretty rare i only used it in one so i do know if the problem is from my
to have a solution that works i owned a few in the past and this one is one of the
seen it also does wiggle it way out of the socket over time like some accessories appreciate the fact that
and age you may need something like this in your to run your gps cell phone player etc it nice
plug into this by far is the best dual socket charger adapter out there pictures do not do this justice
pictures do not do this justice fits tight into the charger works great with my escort x and droid x
here in my country brazil put a upgrade in my and lots of ford fans are looking for it this
more as considering to install tow package in my second now i purchased this lock thinking that if a defect
fuel tank and filler neck coupling in a fairly old i could not find parts to replace these i tried
tiniest crack you can ran the tank empty angled the on stand to make sure the remaining gas did not
use as a shock absorber my wife backed into another in a parking lot the light was destroyed but no
be the right product to fill the gap in my life put it in place and it like a charm
the water this leaves behind great size for drying a absorbs like a champ however a star has been deducted
to get a good wring towel did almost of my from those would be an give this product and it
better results with paper towels love this product dries a any better than this i only bought a new one
because i felt i should have one with my new still have other ones works awesome i replaced an year
cars i recommend this product to everyone who washes their i would recommend this for anyone that needs to use
and works great i use this towel for drying the you have to wet it first like a regular chamois
it does leave streaks of water left behind of the but if you constantly dry the towel it works like
it in the washing machine it will not dry the as it used to i love this product works just
love this product works just how i expected to my faster than just using towels so far i think it
if you have tried product yet you been drying your the hard way i never seen a material that dries
many uses but i just use it to dry my after a good you will be surprised by how much
easy to use and care for you can clean your your bike your other big things of super grandeur or
the water it is just not good at drying the for the final wipe i use a towel after using
absorber is amazing and is absolutely perfect for drying a buy it i own a porsche and this is my
porsche and this is my preferred item to dry my after washing why anyone would continue to dry their car
when it comes to online excellent when washing my black with this absolute necessity when cleaning your car i use
my black car with this absolute necessity when cleaning your i use it in conjunction with a microfiber cloth to
it in conjunction with a microfiber cloth to dry my also i have a chinese ali version and clearly this
then again with a window cleaning product makes drying the a snap at my job we transport all levels of
is probably the best product i used to dry my with very absorbent and easy to use this thing works
past it absorbs much more than the lambskin and my was spot free the real test was the sunroof on
spot free the real test was the sunroof on my where the water tends to pool and leave water spots
anymore definitely a must have for those who wash their as another reviewer noted these are at local big box
price was good always use a chamois after washing my this one works as you would expect and leaves no
of a product i purchased this specifically for drying my after a quick hand wash it only took about minutes
wash it only took about minutes to dry my whole to a streak free shine only using this and no
damp i recently purchased this item for my dog and however i have had great use with it in the
to buy toilet paper again stars other than drying your this cloth has many other uses it can be used
i one of those car guys that will wash their even when rain is predicted so i very particular this
his and he said was really great in cleaning his brock for a convertible in the pacific northwest this is
the softtop protectant faster plus it works for drying the in a self car better than a chamois in absorbing
plus it works for drying the car in a self better than a chamois in absorbing not produce streaks when
by far is the best option for drying off the after washing i have used i like the fact that
in this product has cut the time to wash my significantly whether it soaking up a spill drying a freshly
up a spill drying a freshly mopped floor or wet this thing soaks up the water i have purchased more
vary i have used this for years to dry my after washing as well as a few other spills i
not china there is nothing finer than a freshly washed when it is finished with the spots on the streaks
finished with the spots on the streaks on the the shiny i believe that this product is mislabeled as a
the surface the true chamois i used to watch my previously absorbed very minimal water but when rung out and
live in cold weather and left this cloth in my only find that it became extremely hard i am not
to a cloth have tried multiple times to dry my after a car wash with this hard piece of cloth
have tried multiple times to dry my car after a wash with this hard piece of cloth thinking that it
initially purchased one of these years ago to dry my then i used it to dry my mountain bike after
training i still carry a couple of towels in the for dirt but if he mostly just wet this works
and requires no washing afterwards just keep it in the ok i had to try use these for my little
as well it does remove of the water from your but a film will be left it is best seen
glass it absolutely does a great job of drying the but you may need to follow with a microfiber towel
a number of times already and it really cleans the well i would recommend anyone who needs one to get
research people this thing is the best for drying your it helps so much when washing your own car do
your car it helps so much when washing your own do use rags that will drag dirt hold onto rocks
water and by the time i ready to dry the it fully and ready to go i use it to
use it to squeegee most of the water off the then i do a final dry with microfiber i also
else i have used this three times it dries my well after each use i have stored it damp and
i do like handleing mold or rubbing mold on my i think i will go back to towels this is
this is awesome a must have after washing a black i like the container it came in keeps it moist
container it came in keeps it moist and clean dries quick no streaks left also like that the carrying case
my car becomes an easy job i can dry the very quickly after washing it with soap and it with
the absorber for years now it is the best for washing in my opinion i buy a new one every
and gets very stiff first time i tried drying my with that i felt like i had to get it
even soften it up enough to use it over my even after getting wet it still was the same consistency
on it after i wash it i own a black and it really kind of like having a part time
it the only towel you need to dry your whole windows mirrors and all good drying and easy to clean
of water is easy to wring out and dries the spotless then all you do is it off with warm
my brother showed me how to use one on my i will never buy one of those cheap blue things
never buy one of those cheap blue things at the wash ever again streak free finish easy it figuratively sucks
finish easy it figuratively sucks up the water off your the texture is hard to get used to it is
other now stays on my keep this product in my i have always just rolled it up after i use
this is it i will only put this on my after i give it a nice bath will not scratch
a real absorber my husband uses these on his classic especially when we are at a car show and it
on his classic car especially when we are at a show and it rains or he washes the dust off
after use it just dries out in the of the and it has a peculiar smell i dumped it after
tube drench it with water then wring it if your is freshly waxed and water is beading on it before
and water is beading on it before you dry your with the absorber use your like a squeegee to remove
moisture repeat those two steps for the rest of your if you getting streaks wipe a little slower a chamois
of these for the better part of years for my and just recently ordered an additional absorber to use strictly
so these absolutely leave a streak free shine on your but they are good for windows and you have to
less of a hassle i first go all over the to somewhat squeegee most of the water off with one
could be happier i use this product to wipe my off when i clean it and it works great would
put it back in the case keep it in the with you for the unexpected spill or for when you
unexpected spill or for when you come out of the wash and your car is still soaking wet i am
when you come out of the car wash and your is still soaking wet i am not easily impressed i
only thing my husband will ever use to dry a after washing you drag it across the wet surface to
your vehicle after washing and rinsing unless you use the wash and it works great with that as well it
for longer than i can remember i never dry my or motorcycles with anything else they do damage the finish
far the best drying tool available anywhere swimmers use them cleaners use them any time you have liquid that needs
and bath floor real quick after a shower dries the after a and all this very very well this is
two works as advertised i used it to dry my after a wash i have tried to wash it in
it in warm water wrung it out then dried my with it i laid the whole piece down on half
held any more water they sell it for emergency water looks great completely dry with no towels or i am
works great these are amazing i would not wash my without it i went from using and washing or towels
than a chamois and just sucks the water off the without streaking very impressive also appears to last forever and
the container in the bucket i used to wash the that way the water in the absorber container does not
a new absorber which i use to dry my sports and my wife suv however i noticed recently that the
stop sucking water i wonder if i can finish whole in just something to try lol it works exactly as
dirty this product really works well in for drying my it is of a good size for me and has
completely suck up every bit of water after rinsing the but it didnt even being mostly dry and wringing out
able to use it twice i use this for my washes on the daily they make my life so much
and finally had to replace it i would dry a with out one i have used an absorber for years
these things work great i only used it on my but you can use it for other purposes as well
i bought this specifically to clean the interior of my as other reviews said it would leave lint it really
guy that details cars i just bought a new black and as we know streaks and marks stand out on
it out as it absorbs and you will have your clean and streak free in no time if it is
does absorb a lot of water and is the best dryer i have ever had after you wash the car
car dryer i have ever had after you wash the run the absorber over the car and of the water
after you wash the car run the absorber over the and of the water gets removed when the towel gets
less than with a standard towel or chamois if the is in the sun or if you have hard water
have hard water or if you are meticulous about your it may be a good thing to run a microfiber
a good thing to run a microfiber towel over the after you use the absorber to get the rest of
container for next time this is a great product for drying or for cleaning up wet spills i highly recommended
sits in a moist environment between uses but as a dryer it is terrific i comparison shop a lot before
so far it has worked perfectly even on my black i wash the car pull it into the garage and
worked perfectly even on my black car i wash the pull it into the garage and quickly dry it with
absorber i was using old towels to dry off my after i washed it now i love using the absorber
on the one i bought says it will dry a in minutes and i guess if you could wipe and
with me and it was done i walked around the expecting to have to do some finishing up but it
have to ring it out often works perfectly for the bought for a water therapy dog vet she uses them

car this thing works it is amazing i wash my and dry it spotless with this little baby once it
from a deer skin was used the absorber for about washes and it has held up to almost as many

to use this chamois over a towel while drying a the absorber works well with soaking up water then with
the chamois does not leave cloth and lint on your like towels and old shirts i also use a damp
back over it with the chamois it will cut your drying time in half and work as good you are

the function of chock is for the accidental circumstances the slipped back however it is not usually happened when the
slipped back however it is not usually happened when the is put on the parking gear and hand brake is
so hard to say it good or working unless the is really accidentally slipped back and blocked by this wheel
only downside i bought these to ride around in the for a tire changing emergency they are good sized and
and weigh a bit i still have them in the but they are feather light for gas mileage works good
on the reviews i kept having to jack up my to fix a in a back tire and i throw

one is larger than a normal rearview mirror in a but if you want that here it is also last
decreased on the passengers side as you can see a in the mirror through the window so not only do
is not that good the rear view mirror in the has fallen off three times in the past few years
but provides a safer view of what is behind your plus cleaning the inside windshield will be easier i just
accidents the mirror is perfect i use it in my to be able to see my grandson in his car
in place very clear view excellent baby mirror for the at first i was a bit skeptical but after reading
the window longer than a day i realized that my back window has defroster lines in it which were possibly
windows with defroster lines or to sit in a hot all day the mirror itself is great i can clearly
adjusting its neck will break i use it in my the custom mirror felt down like times the re attachment
getting pricy so decided to try this out in my and i got ta say that i do not regret
what i needed to attach to the windshield in her so that i can see everything behind us as we
the child in the back seat mirrors at almost any wash this mirror for the money out shined itself perfect
works great as a front mounted mirror for forward facing seat it been mounted to a clean windshield for or
work van it is very large much larger than our rear view mirror the bigger problem for us is that
it is hard to see him in his rear facing seat know matter what i did it would not stick
mounting holes recommended i bought this to use in my as a big mirror to see my child but it

use it after every flight tried this on my kids navigation screen that was severely marred this detailer had to
as well as a standalone love meguiar and use their care products almost exclusively on my cars but this is
is that it holds a charge while sitting for a it is not an issue because you start it every

golf diesel keeps me from haveing to climb under the and it takes out more oil than just using the
this is really worth put the extract tube in the and pump it up go off and do something else
do this maybe times and your does help if the is a little warm but it will work if it
of money and time since there no more taking the our for the oil change my only complaint is the
car requires that a shield be removed from under the to change oil with the pump i no longer have
half the oil was sucked i used it on the well i stuck the tube all the way down to
numerous other uses such as the antifreeze out of the container works for atvs or anytime you have a fluid
pump to remove a quart of transmission fluid in my to make room for an additive this pump should do
of those hand pump extractors the other week on my and i got so fed up with it that i
no longer have to drain the oil from beneath the follow the directions about warming the engine up first and
that is an extra step but i usually change both oil at once and do want to risk the extractor

been using the club for years and happened to my i use the club even if i have to go
for one minute my if i come out and my has been stolen i would never forgive myself for not
i realize that if a pro wanted to steal my it would be stolen club is for the average every
with how visible it will be if someone wants my there going to take it this is a good deterent
the club is just what we needed for my sons it will help him feel safer about parking his car
car it will help him feel safer about parking his in a school parking lot i have used the club
a reasonable price i recommend buying this product for your safety i have nothing to say but that the club
would have never purchased it makes a great deterrent for thieves and is built enough to be used in self
almost years ago after a freind of mine had his stolen from a trailhead while rock climbing in the this
i had the club theives would move on from my to an easier mark in the parking lot i only
easy to use and years later i still have my my mitsubishi outlander es base trim already came with an

use a club wheel lock i did and now my is secured what is to say it the club it

especially if you do have the cash to replace your or truck my neighbor has an alarm and does use

awful experience i bought the club because i park my on the street and rarely drive it i did want
the street and rarely drive it i did want my to become a target so i thought purchasing the club
was a great idea before putting the club on my i read the directions and tested the keys the directions
went ahead and locked my steering wheel i left my on the street for days but on the fourth day
for minutes i had no choice but to leave my on the street consequently i ended up receiving a parking
locksmith ended up having to cut the club off my and sadly the locksmith cost me an extra admittedly my

it seems to deter people from even breaking into my plus it gives me a little peace of mind knowing
gives me a little peace of mind knowing that my will not likely be stolen it was a little annoying
making it a deterrent to those who might my new the key hole in the lock is large enough that
bad guys that may just move on to the next i am using my second club now i tossed my
to finish and then relieving you of your wallet and and possibly bother calling the company they wo help you
it will get stolen if you do take precautions the parts are what they i got this for my daughters

this blanket thinking it would keep me warm in my at work when i on lunch and do wan na
when i on lunch and do wan na run the engine to keep warm plugged it in to socket and
and the light on the cord came on while the just got colder and colder i waited and waited and
was there was no noticeable increase in warmth in the either wow what a gimmick i should have known it
bought this blanket for two purposes to use in the while traveling and not driving and to use with my
chilled fingers it heats up in minutes and covers two seats that are next to each other the switch is
polar air this winter i have needed to warm the up before leaving so it warmed up by the time
to have and i feel better knowing it in my in case of emergencies as long as you have power
idea i take my lunch time mostly out in my and i just plug this in and i am toasty
this in and i am toasty warm without running my i originally got one of these for my car since
where my two hang out now they can go for rides with me more often as we head into fall
warm when i ride in the back seat of the i purchased this for my year old dad he is
those freezing cold mornings when you are waiting for the to heat up it is terrific to have this wonderful
one for each car i keeps me warm in the but does not heat up very much just takes the
clean on dashboard this fleece is only to us eith appliance not with an normal electric appliance what we didn

my wife loves this heated blanket while riding in the this winter no waiting for the car heater to stay
husband has many physical problems and rides along in the whenever possible but is not able to do any shopping
keep him warm while he is patiently waiting in the without having to turn the ignition on once it is
bought this because my girlfriend always gets cold in my and i got tired of hearing her complain also we
never got too hot and did shut off when my was turned off i suppose it may stay on if
turned off i suppose it may stay on if your will allow for this either way she still uses it
his carseat warm in our alaska winter temperatures until the was able to warm up after a trip to the
off my morning drive because the heater core in the went out this electric blanket never gets warm wish i
gets luke warm just buy a fleece blanket for the we did an instant refund and shipped the blanket back
works perfectly and is great to just keep in the and use when recommended i recommend this for all people
for all people who do have a heater in the or who have poorly functioning heaters this product will warm
minutes then shuts off it sucks very handy in my the blanket heats up very fast and keeps me nice
elderly mother loves to wrap it around her in the even though the car has heated seats she still likes
purchased one for myself and it is always in the we bought this blanket for traveling in our motorhome but
traveling in our motorhome but also use it for the the red plaid material is soft and appealing we did
a bad one this blanket is so wonderful for the especially on cold days it warms the seat and keeps
am really enjoying my travel blanket i have an older and just do want to pay for the heater to
the first product i have purchased like this but my is without heat and i needed something to take the
blanket keeps me warm on the way to work while is heating up also keeps me warm each morning while
warm each morning while i take a nap in my at work after my commute fine quality blanket adds just
comes with a outlet for those electric things in a type of plug had to cut that off and just
one works perfectly my wife is forever cold in the also i ca live without the air on she is
with no issues it heat up quickly faster than the heater i might add i bought this for my daughter
by volts dc current was something i bought for the this winter expecting very little how warm would something of
you be surprised it heats twice as fast as the heater when the car and the blanket are started at
heats twice as fast as the car heater when the and the blanket are started at the same time it
on the convertible in cool weather another blanket in the would just be too much trouble this blanket just does
purchased for a friend who travels and naps in his perfect for taking the chill off in michigan winters i
the go and sit in the passenger seat and your heater is warm enough this is the blanket for you
this blanket because the heat no longer works in my it larger than i expected and it heats up quickly
works well a good size for the backseat of your small enough to keep in the trunk what a dud
east coast great it puts out great heat in the the auto shut off is good and adjustable from to
the icedozer made me worry that i might break my when i use it this ice scraper works great on
had in february it ok for pushing snow off your it pushes great but it not long enough to push
glass anyway over designed overly complex and overly priced my was in a thick coat of ice i was trying
not wide nor very good for brushing snow off the i then used my cent snow scraper to brush off
me forever while i tried brushing the snow off the with the icedozer the brush fell off i snapped it
when we had a thin layer of frost on our it worked just fine to remove it quickly and efficiently
love it i was able to clear all of my windows in a minute it is alot better that the
arrived just before almost of ice was deposited on my it handled it easily also allowing me to sweep the
big car i was having to lean up against the just to get everything not user friendly at complaints not
windshields i bought more after that experience for my second and for a i would definitely buy again as well
the right to remove the ice and snow from my this tool just demolishes the ice and the snow mover
the snow off of the hood and roof of my without me getting covered with snow doing ca wait for
does this sound like the most ideal tool for your after a the snow falls well it so not that
through inches of ice my solution was to run the with the defroster on high for mins which forms a
is great for getting ice off of your windshield and it breaks right through even thick cakes of ice quarter
or so but when you actually getting snow on your the brush that comes with is super helpful i think
helpful i think for a real prepared to clean your trunk package you need to combine this with a brush
or get the windows clear i couldnt warm up my and it still did a good job with the glaze
a chance i love it a ice scraper that every should the beginning people will look at you as crazy
longer struggle on cold days with getting ice off by first off i do own one of these and have
the downside that it very large to store in your i love it clears the ice very fast and you
night then sleet and freezing rain so by am the had inch of ice on the windshield and back window
a good inch on the side windows i started the got out the scraper and in about minutes or less
move around under your vehicle may need to jack the a little higher to accommodate the extra height but it
problem it probably crack after my first visit thru the for the cost of this shield i could have purchased
out a huge pile of dust from the filter my was barely able to make it over the mountain pass
beating the dust out it left a huge pile the ran perfectly again other than that it been miles since
got the lexus exhaust and this by itself made the way more throaty and peppy got this for my heritage
great job at preventing damage to the hood of the this bug shield is a must for colorado gravel during
and they look great again a must have for your if you are messy or you get your feet muddy
son with a dissapointing christmas present matching fit better flow breaths better better sound from intake do have to change
something to think about if you happened to have a with somewhat different maf sensor that is not very sensitive
always have installed a k n air filter in every i have owned and immediatly feel the difference well worth
more powerful that why every time i get a new my first upgrade is to swap out the stock air
around to installing one in my truck and my wife both run better and no more changing filters every miles
miles or so i used to have a dirt race and i had a k n filter in it with
looking into getting a few more horses out of your or truck this is where you start my husband was
about this filter so i bought him one for my it makes a little difference in gas mileage but the
vice buying paper filters which means the rest of the life is gravy need to buy a recharge kit as
years i will automatically put one of these in every i buy i wish my furnace had a filter this
of giving it back to you when you retrieved your it would be proof that they were incompetent and you
some power i going to get one for my wifes filter fit nicely not much increase on mpg however under
hoped only getting about mpg better it really good air be quite faster economy and cold air for the engine
being cleaned another great k n product i am a enthusiast i rebuilt several motors ported polished some i done
its part matching tool which matches the part to the great product and a great name helped to improve air
gallon this is something that you really need for your it definitely worth it to pay a little extra money
too high and as you bring your foot in the it will hit the top of the mat every time
filters i seen i love the performance that gives the and security that meets your work in any environment we
had been looking for a good trash bag for the glad i gave it a try now all three of
just as good as any container floating around in your i very much regret this purchase the size and style
passenger and driver i bought this to use in my it stays put in the car it has velcro on
to use in my car it stays put in the it has velcro on the bottom and a weighted base
or anything else you do want getting lose in your before you make it to the trash it has a
for keeping small messy things from getting lose in the tip use a plastic bag as a liner so it
a nice alternative to a hanging trash bag or a floor filled with feel free to let amazon and me
the bin in place securely works great to keep my neat i have this on the floor in the rear
happy with this purchase great assistance in keeping a clean this is the perfect size for a small vehicle it
and it has side pockets to store things like my charger and it ok but two things i do like
had problems finding the perfect container for trash in the and this one does the trick it fits right behind
container although i am the only person who uses my only one person worth of trash and am relatively neat
for people that spend a lot of time in their i like this little trash container helps keep the car
car i like this little trash container helps keep the tidier it nicely weighted in the base so it does
great i grew tired of all the that littered my i not the neatest person but this helps me improve
not the neatest person but this helps me improve that charger gps holder trash can etc use it several ways
is thick i like that it remains steady in my and that it can be cleaned out in case something
of it i will definitely use it in my new my advice is that if you are looking for something
bang for your bucks this is the answer to your litter problems i use this on my car and it
size container would hold considering what you have in your in my car i have small water bottles other drink
hold considering what you have in your car in my i have small water bottles other drink containers an occasional
i felt it would take away from the of the the lexus has a flattened hump between the two back
place and almost looks as if it came with the i absolutely love it it was just the right size
but the velcro does stick to the carpet in my so it falls over sometimes i wish the side walls
is a nice small container which is great for the this product arrived looks great but the snap on inside
have kids there is always trash to clean in the but these move too much and was just taking up
perfect it was just what i was looking in the works good love it everything i needed satisfied i like
this so we would have a trash bag in the and this is great this litterbag is larger on the
like this because it makes me remove trash from my on a more regular basis while still having a designated
keep extra napkins and tissues pretty increased the of my at least fold great for keeping the car clean of
easy to empty i was having trash in my new everywhere and then my wife pointed out the guys love
and then my wife pointed out the guys love their and see how you kept it your that day only
recommend this to all people who want to keep their clear best for car the weighted and velcro base keep
people who want to keep their car clear best for the weighted and velcro base keep this product in place
in it will probably order another one for the other this is a nice little trash bag well made and
guess you would want so much trash sitting in your anyways as to liquids i think it will do fine
it back i had this little trash bag in my for probably years it has been very useful and never
looking for a different style of trash can for my this litterbag works great in the space between the shift
i use it a lot and it helps keep my clean great buy this will not fit a chevy silverado
just barely fits around the visor in my two door though good and basic just the right fit for my
it fit perfectly on my visor i have a small and was a little concerned that it might be too
walls and more importantly for the well being of the doors and they look good a few of my neighbors
it in a great idea saves those accidental wall two garage yeah with inches between my side the wall and
with inches between my side the wall and the wifes open the door for to get out and the first
like i wanted it takes up no room and prevents doors from getting if they are opened too wide the
i ordered years ago and loved how they kept my door edge from bashing and tearing the garage drywall board
easy install bought two of these to protect front rear doors from swinging into wall of garage and chipping paint
one you thank yourself for installing these and saving your doors i can not tell a lie the person who
been using it happily ever since really helps protect our door from the garage wall we affixed strips of weather
installation works as advertised no dents in wall from opening door to far i have also use them for the
so i decided to apply the same to my personal truck i have been hit yet not that that proof
even better in the winter when i could start the from the kitchen window and get in a nice warm
from the kitchen window and get in a nice warm for my long drive to work instead of riding freezing
time installed the plugs in my honda accord and the ran great what more could you ask for for some
and installed them myself took about an hour and the runs like new not that it did not prior to
they did look too bad but once i replaced the ran really smoth the amazon price was a lot better
uses or it like checking my the temp inside my etc i got another one for work for similar has
dries my skin temp rises to about degrees my heated seats get up to about degrees no wonder i always
the size of the compartments love it i have another with a trunk organizer from the vehicle manufacturer and i
it to others i bought one of these for my and loved it so much i bought one for hubby
and loved it so much i bought one for hubby too perfect for loading groceries in the trunk and it
makes for an awkward endeavor to get it into the afterward would hesitate to recommend this i received the first
may begin to melt find mounting bolts already on your lift your hood and design and fabricate a metal bracket
best if you gon na put driving lights on you or truck dont mess around with other brands piaa have
dollars and go with the instead of the the best cover available i owned covercraft car covers since the and

box it very clearly stated this cover will fit a feet long my torino measures feet long truthfully it was
car was a moldy stinking disaster this cover ruined the do not use this cover for outdoor storage after bouncing
fit i decided to go with the covercraft technalon series cover i purchased it because i was going out of
been for a few months now and i have the started up ever weeks to let it run from the
still ike new and there are no new scratches and looks like the day it went under this is exactly
an excellent outdoor cover if you want to protect your from uv or bird droppings this is the one do

the rope are very well made the cover protected the from the sun and dried quickly after it rained i
from area i use it wherever i am even the i bought this for an unusual reason i use a
holds a charge fine i do leave it in the to loose it charge over the course of the months
conditions that you find in the trunk of a normal particularly if you do not have your own garage i
do use this product make sure that electrical in the is turned off before trying to jumpstart your car otherwise
the car is turned off before trying to jumpstart your otherwise the wipers radio lights or whatever will drain too
juice and you will not be able to jumpstart your now years later the product wo hold a charge at
yes still has a full granted it wo start a that with a fully dead battery but either will my
live in an area where you get cold weather your is either sitting in cold temperatures or in the blazing
where it only useful for those rare times when the battery has died in my driveway ideally it needs some
system to keep itself fully charged while sitting in the you can hook it up to your car cigarette lighter
in the car you can hook it up to your cigarette lighter to charge it but i do not get
car you likely find yourself stranded with both a dead battery and a discharged jump starter and you need a
dead you ca charge this thing up from a dead battery it seemed like a good idea when i bought
above freezing weather do depend on this to get your started in a jam you will have more success push
a jam you will have more success push starting your uphill in about years the unit battery failed to charge
it living up to it title of jump starting a i not tried that have doubts i was taught in
me that just like this is the size of a battery you wo get but about that much power from
the hood to the driver seat try to start the in that situation you wo get started without true jumper
without true jumper cables from another car a full size battery to jump from or charging the cars battery for
to go out it has to be taken in your i made the mistake of letting my trash back up
for work i got a text from him saying your smells horrible i almost threw up wtf i said leave
of cig smoke and more also use it in my to make it smell fresher have ordered this product twice
a lot in it was sprayed ozium all over the closed the doors and waited over night no real change
this into my intake vents under the hood of my i took out the cabin air filter and turned on
system so yes this stuff works decently well however my is still not nor will it ever be smoke free
but this worked a little gon na buy a new as soon as i can but in the meantime this
even gets rid of the toughest smoke smells in my and bedroom i recommend this to anyone i liked this
odors around the house i used it in my friend to get rid of the moldy tobacco smell he ca
smell he ca stand it when i get in his and start highly recommend this product versus smelly crap you
air freshener look somewhere else but if for example your smells and you need to get rid of the smell
product to get rid of mary jane smells in my after visiting some forums and reading amazon reviews it works
works great usually sometimes when i get back in my i can smell the tiniest hint of mary jane but
did i recommend not spraying it until you are leaving over night it is rather noxious and spraying the product
anything this product is amazing i just bought a new that smelled like smoke and i did a lot of
if you need to get a smell out of your buy this product i used it in the medical field
wife describes as lemongrass i keep a can in my so i do smell it up after a cigar at
sprays should do the trick i bought this for a that sat for a long time and smelled like mice
can tell no difference in the slight smell of the i sprayed to make certain i used it again spraying
to have masked the smell by the next day the smelled exactly as it did before a slight but unpleasant
rite aid in the auto section to use it for air fresheners takes all odors right out of a room
to get the light musty smell out of the used that we bought i replaced the air filter and then
and the vents with the ozium and left the sprayed over night it also works well to clear the musty
house i assume that if you use it in a it will go away faster with open windows it gets
enough to be noticeable over normal road noise although the radio drowns it out at normal volume i think i
boxes or wires running all over the floor of the perfect for my laptop and for my cell phone charger
in mine ok so i the type that needed a adapter for cell phone kids dvd player radio between each
so no switch so it needs be unplugged if a does support of automatic switch off of cig fan moving
hear the fan now i do not need carry different chargers for different electronics any more i use the xantrex
is a problem this product is so usefull in my come packed so goog your function is so basic but
any item and you do even have to start the as long as th radio is on this will chage
you will never have to worry about having the right again this is perfect and works for any car this
right car again this is perfect and works for any this item is poorly constructed it failed after using it
this because we go on summer trips and my dad has a dvd player but the headphones do work so
but the headphones do work so i looked up computer charger saw alot of these but always look at the
looks just like the pic i plug it in the the reviews said the fan was loud i had to
you it on you do need to turn on the for it to work it runs on the car battery
the car for it to work it runs on the battery but i do think it it dry it big
so hard to find a place for it if you a small car but i put it in a found
in a found a place for it and if the breaks down we can use our phone and when we
charged in a vehicle without having to purchase a separate charger for each in our family everyone has a different
more we decided to just buy an inverter for each and that way we can just plug in the charger
included with each phone we never buy another cell phone charger again and we be all set to plug in
fan noise which is easily overcome by playing in the so far this has been a wonderful product it is
it worked great for us we took it in the to play movies for our kids on the computer while
not distracting or annoying locate the power outlet in your to make sure this product will fit the power outlet
sure this product will fit the power outlet in our is at a weird angle tucked in the console and
it is a good item to convert dc in the to ac we used it a few times and it
to expect fan noise it sort of like having your on other than that i ca think of anything negative
with the product came in handy when i forgot my charger for my laptop and only had the wall plug
device it allows me to use my laptop in the it is cheap to buy and small for travel it
in a tight space but it is fine on my and a couple of rental cars that we used it
much more finicky about the power coming from our old battery bottom line it is a price performer item looks
inside this inverter which is high and even dominates your ac fan at max point to tell here is i
tell here is i used in my accord check your power system specs before you buy this product checking this
right product i bought this product to safe money in charger the only is that this product is a little
noisy we used this inverter while traveling on vacation by we were able to power up and stay connected to
plugging the wall charger into this inverter while in the i love it powers my laptop cell phone video camera
a notebook or similar it is much cheaper than the chargers sold for computers worked great and at a great
tailgate it worked great also instead of buying a unique adapter for each product you can now use this product
one anyway back to the micro inverter life saver the charger fuse must have died on our portable dvd player
out by a cd playing the front part of the while the children blissfully passed the time watching dvds great
the time watching dvds great product to have in the at all times great portable inverter for the car i
the car at all times great portable inverter for the i am in montana and it works great for my
honestly not too bad you can hear it when the is parked or moving slowly but the moment you drive
with my laptop and phone charger do leave in the because it can overheat only regret is wish i had
life saver i have chronic pain in my back and rides are awful for me this last weekend i went
from south dakota and had very little trouble on the ride i know it is because i was able to
i was able to use my heating pad in the i love this produce and would recommend it to anyone
mile road trip it powered my ipod dock since the ancient stereo does really work the thing is sort of
small for me i am using for buffering waxing the and it is working super it is totally worth it
glove box no wires no need to hook up to battery its plug n play and very convenient for me
i gotten a lot of use of this on long trips the only downside is that it is a little
deter me from trying it so i went to the to try press the button it starts you hear the
is very nice and would strongly recommend have an old and needed to wire it directly to the battery because
in college and been finding my self sitting in my surfing the internet and doing some then my laptop battery
recharging the batteries i can sit for running off my battery and not drain it or have to start engine
for over and hour and still had volts in the battery i have a drive to college and back every
you may need to plug in like a printer for is old and when i first plugged it in the
for about this is why i had to rewire my very old and now with a new hot wire off
jump the car battery pump up bike tires top off tires and even to power the sump pump during a
a long winter of sitting inflating bike tires topping off tires good battery lasts a fairly long time if you
and safer to use rather than trying to park another close enough and using jumper cables it is a bit
light it does provide plenty of light to find the battery and hook it up at night it great to
pack if you buy it for powering small items jumping batteries and pumping up tires it will serve you well
cell phones and i used it to jump a dead battery and inflate a flat tire i searched the internet
up in addition it has a standard dc plug for accessories and two ac plugs for running lights or very
i not sure how well it would work on our tires but we have used it to inflate bike used
able get out of it we keep one in the and bought a second one to keep in our house
i purchased it let me review each jump starting a worked flawlessly and repeatedly we had a minivan that was
smoke as time went on they worked fine for normal tires though it was a slow process now even normal
my efforts to try to start the engine of a with a low battery has never worked either it just
to buying more laptop batteries or having to run your just to recharge your are my only complaints while charging
plug it back in the connection to recharge from the is sticky not a good fit also the charging light
is ugly is that when you need to jumpstart your chances are your nerves are already a little and having
up all the juice in the generator he used his to recharge it it says it would take hours to
computer without running out of power it recharges using the lighter and while you at home you can leave it
the cars battery i purchased this to bring along on trips to laptops cell phones and for car trouble caution
along on car trips to laptops cell phones and for trouble caution it heavy so keeping this in the backseat
it heavy so keeping this in the backseat of your for extended periods of time is a good idea since
trips i sometimes remember to put it back in the at least i do remember to take it on long
had zero problems and i even used to air my tires took a few minutes to go up psi it
both cars and bikes regularly i have jumped my own several times and other peoples i have used all three
and the flashlight when i had to jump my neighbor in the middle of the night when it was in
the powerpack so far i used it to jump my inflate more than a few tires and power my laptop
of times with respect to low air pressure on my super handy when you go camping and all your friends
it difficult to get it this model is designed for emergencies it has a trouble light jump starts a dead
rigged to an inverter for ac devices and a standard dc input it charges up much faster than it says
and is said to do so faster direct from the you get adapters to do both we will keep it
have used several times for power air supply jumped a battery much easier than using another car very handy useful
supply jumped a car battery much easier than using another very handy useful for emergencies as well as everyday convenience
you can recharge the battery by attaching it to your battery and running the car for a few i did
by attaching it to your car battery and running the for a few i did not buy this unit to
i did not buy this unit to jump start my with the included cables i have used it for this
used it for this purpose twice in both cases the battery was completely dead and my normal jump starting battery
my normal jump starting battery would not jump start the this xantrex power pack had absolutely no problem starting the
this xantrex power pack had absolutely no problem starting the having it available to jump start my car just one
starting the car having it available to jump start my just one time paid for itself as far as i
ac outlets of the inverter or if you have a power supply for your laptop you can plug your laptop
these are great for charging up and keeping in the or keeping in the house in case you lose power
you lose power the pump is a little weak for tires but it only for emergencies i have read the
simply used for emergency power the occasional jump start and tire psi top off it helped me out a few
leaking slowly but was able to inflate and get the to a repair remember religiously follow the recommended recharging intervals
though i would recommend anyone keeping this unit in their because even the manufacturer lists a few restrictions that could
way i even use it to clean my toilet and i use the bath soaps and love them and wanted
works i even used it to get a really good washing the smell is great i use it for everything
do need much when cleaning got grease off my daughters seats bought small bottle of body wash and i love
be used in so many ways it cleans the house and even your body i have just started using this
install using it to set up air suspension for accessable with rear wheel chair lift i pull a foot fifth
and leveled my truck great product perfect look for my with stock white speedometer face gauges works perfectly and the
ratio gauge is not very useful it taps into the stock oxygen sensor and as a result what you see
results this gauge is excellent for automotive enthusiasts running a excellent quality these fit perfect and look amazing they would
the intakes and the carbs great value for your muscle got this one for my corvette with emissions it was
drone yep it a series sounds bad ass help the breath better and gave more performance was on highway had

on my from illinois since installing this new carb the is running as smooth as silk however maybe it just
smooth as silk however maybe it just imagined but the seems a wee bit slower than before perhaps some adjustments
the performance of the carburetor so i installed it the was running rich it was fine with the thunder cfm
me tell ya it freakin awesome it totally gave my a meaner louder more aggressive sound i recommend this to
tag at local muffler shops i installed it in my and sounds great it has the perfect tone i love
say that i am blown away by this muffler my is making sounds and hitting notes i never could have
all the time what kind of muffler i have my sounds like a some say it sounds like a racecar
well spent i am pleased the neighbors probably are my needs a license plate hell on wheels because that is
deep rumble that you can only hear when behind the at wide open throttle however other know that you mean
sweet intoxicating i get blurred visions of a and muscle with pounding pistons and dancing roller excited valves and all
the sound of flowmasters i have these on another muscle and they have lasted years so far with no issues
there is nothing quite like having one in your own i highly recommend this one if you have a car
car i highly recommend this one if you have a like mine and want a nice roar from your exhaust
is there is no annoying vibration or anything inside the so the ride comfort stays the same have exhaust tip
nothing like a civic trying to sound like a stock it a more tuned sound rather than an startup it
are great just bought our third pair for our third does that tell you something this product looks great on
after days the check engine light came on and the refused to go above rpm kept cutting out and jerking
other part store look for the item that matches my and purchase here it is a perfect fit much better
to change the filter as long as i have the but as far as it increasing any i am a
and am hoping never to replace air filter in this again so worth the money only in the car for
this car again so worth the money only in the for about a month now with about miles since so
has spent trying to improve gas mileage and power every made in the world would have these as original equipment
cheapest and most effective upgrade i have done on my the airflow improves drastically so does the exhaust note increased
cars fits well and its for the life of the i have noticed a little more power in the mid
improved good buy stop buying throw away filters for your k n filters last forever and you do have to
past replacement time stock air filter that came with the is much better i had to adjust my shifting schedule
faster was hesitant to put the k n on this because i read about them allowing larger particulates into your
oil kits k n filters could last longer than your but you enjoy not worrying about having to change another
because i love the new found power in my old buy one now you wont be sorry you did great
is just thick n air is way better now my can breath better best thing is it reusable can you
on on a altima still getting buy another in miles runs much more smoothly now easy to install my car
car runs much more smoothly now easy to install my had miles should have installed this much earlier k n
would recommend buying one if you plan on keeping your for the next years or more it should pay for
so in the past maybe prices changed lighter more your is needs more filtration rather than airflow and you can
consumption as the most likely area for improvement given my pursue other mods like exhaust mods for example first if
me to put a k n filter on my commuter it popped up as a suggestion and i purchased it
gradually dropped to max i thought it was because the was getting old i immediately noticed the power coming back
is night and day before installation if i started the up in park and revved the gas my foot would
down we were at the stomp the gas and the just sat there smoking out the parking lot i not

and without restraint but as of now he drove a and while there was no river there was a road
the only thing i miss in dirt is my favorite from dirt the nissan loved playing dirt and i thought
all the when using the camera view from inside the switching to directx works but the graphics are as good
minute and it only install about i have been playing racing games since their early beginning on pc i currently
severely disappointed there is absolutely no relationship to driving this to anything in real life other than when you step
rally driving you use throttle steering to actually steer the its the defining quality of racing on dirt to do
back to control car rotation but in the game the is impossible to steer straight going on a straight road
options for the most important aspect of driving controlling the instead the game is horribly slowed down by useless graphics
and gravel in a world where keeping control of your is a greater skill than making it around the turns
get the game started minutes into each attempt at a race the entire computer would crash black screen unresponsive does
i read in a review that it was the best game of the graphics are good the car handling is
the best car game of the graphics are good the handling is good althought with a small delay from my
make you do all sorts of challenges like spinning your and making it skid and then different styles of racing
to reset one nervous system i just did enjoy crashing therapy we purchased this product for our local bow hunting
have to do the missions you can just take any you want an go for a joy ride you can
get to paradise depending on the person was bus boat and if very high on the morality meter the number
this person lived determines whether they get to use a a luxury liner or the exclusive no train which speeds
and on babbling while you stuck in a stupid tram sheesh what a bore that kind of nonsense will cost
unheard of at the this game got over game with physics sounds and handling get real right nope all game
bucks that all but gets you a clunker of a which after beating a bunch of driver ed tests you
save to tune later you can finally buy your dream which for me was the acura type the first time
over time you feel so much utter control of your that any shimmy or shake the car makes while cornering
is the gear ratios of a turbo monster of a and trying to get every last ounce of power out
at a time fiddling with the gear ratios on a knowing that someway somehow i be able to squeeze another
you sell that you won from a tournament even a that you know should rake in way more than just
in short get it now overall fabulously entertaining and complex game that really lives up to its reputation you be
the closest thing i could get to driving a real was playing games like well playing games like ummm well
there were no games even close to driving a real then one day at funcoland i picked up a magazine
out called gran turismo and how it was the ultimate game they used real cars and physics to make the
time i loaded in that disk and saw all those names flashing across the screen i almost wet my pants
in a game i mean aspect was there even a wash i have no idea how many hours i spent
edit the pc version not only can you put whatever you want into the game by downloading a simple quick
game by downloading a simple quick device them importing a you can download or make yourself but you can also
specialty where it shows three red shells going around your and it does the same thing as red shell would
because they brought more of a look to cheaters locations weapons and added new cheaters to the story as well
bad i mean still cool there is a new viper you can use rain missiles as weapons some of the
explosion or massive destruction many characters look lame if your turns upside down you have to wait for seconds for
upside down you have to wait for seconds for your to stand up and many stages are very this twisted
market today are about flying a plane or driving a but sim city remains unique as the only true city
things go even more wrong a zombified passenger in the attacks and leon fights but crashes the cruiser into a
do have a joystick so you forced to drive your using the directional buttons what a pain tower of druaga
roof tops is so fun if you want the best combat game for playstation this is it then rouge trip
matter what you taste in cars is there is a that you will like the variety is huge twisted metal
this one was basically you run around is a customized and blow stuff up people landscapes other cars its a
one but this one is game twisted metal is a compitition almost like demolition derby except with crazy characters and
clunky and awkward imitators they really are fast fluid engaging combat this and vigilante should be on every list the
the game can get very anoying with the way the crashes work out some of the races are very repetitive
lovers you race for points by hitting opponents regular stock races and the classic demolition derby with four demolition arenas
out the cash for the ram you can use a or house key to remove the old jumper chip from
play with there a goldeneye multiplayer rip off where your is with missles and bombs and the such you get
and even a ski jump that you can take your off isle self explanitory it a course taking place on
flowers the final championships promise prizes such as the alien and the best car in the the police car beetle

vengeance you go in a car and stop bombs and bombs in new york it is fun i love the
games over all the rest when we take a long ride my two girls ages and have never played so
never played so well together in the backseat of the i do know everything about the game but my kids
more important but it sure is nice on a long ride a must for parents who enjoy peace in the
ride a must for parents who enjoy peace in the a few years ago i lost my red version any
graphics ridge racer type is plausible in this area the designs are fantastic and the roads are clear and fantastic
crashing sounds give this baby a boost value a fun racing game that lasts a long time and challenges you
of responsibility when you win or lose a race the selection is both a good thing and a bad thing
the better cars in the game and definitely not the buy and enjoy this game is the best game for
gbc is great for passing time on long plane or journeys my advise get it now you wo be sorry
at a fair price this is an item for the i had the original and loved it probably logged a
portable so you can take it with you on long rides or vacations the screen is kind of small but
mario deluxe for gameboy color this is perfect for airplanes train and boat trips this is perfect for anything exept
not put it down i took it everywhere in the grandparents etc etc etc it really summer i kept on
on a roadtrip it is like a jungle in are without gameboys but ever since my mom bought us those
few time trials i went on with that toyota concept it was way too sensitive i steer one way it
to feel subtle forces that let you know when the is at the limit of traction makes for a much
get crushed fly through more rings pick up that police and take it to the other side of the road
your personality if you like to drive around in a in new york city or shooting up alien invaders in
scenes like when you take a ride on the cable probably to keep the animation fast without slowing it down
you riding the new age quot rollercoaster quot and mine are very fun the plot was interesting and challenging it
help you catch the apes like the time net rc stun club and much more if you get it you
gadgets you can use to capture the monkeys including an slingshot and monkey radar unfortunately the monkeys are also armed
races you get to fly an airship or drive a the motorcycle chase and you get to play games at
cars absolutely come alive in your hands every change of parameters is felt minutely in your hands and by that
it a fun racing game but the review of the and company history which is rare i hope in the
the code to get the ford indigo its the best a title such as trickstyle has great potential but suffers
game that can add hours of entertainment to a boring ride and it definitly deserves to be bought based on
so small that you can take with you in your and play it but i prefer a dreamcast wow this
can connect to the back of the for in the or any place were no tv is never got a
the ability to race against your opponent and win his makes this the my racing sim of choice many times
have on two player nfs this is one game every or car game fan should have the car selection is

doing fine without what do i look for in a game speed room for error and cars lots of them
it was very very fun it very cool how your gets damaged but you should be able to choose a
for high speed action this game is for all you lovers i had this game for many years and love
expect for it to work properly you woul start a turning the key the other way or filling it with
spin the wheel exactly like the board game your little moves around just like the board game they even copied
we were little we would fantasize about the kind of we would drive the career we would have the we
in the park you can build your own roller coasters rides log flumes and many more the graphics in this
fun when i built my first coaster and heard the moving on the tracks and the screams of the riders
it will throw away and all the people in the will die immediately but this is a healthy game for
if you are using an rc remote to drive the i have not yet tried it with more realistic driving
annoying it makes it next to impossible to manuver the i was able to drive the road courses much easier
