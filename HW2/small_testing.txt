indicator lights are an improvement over earlier models it is fully sealed and works well the price was very good
a amp automatic charger but it is ideally suited for batteries if this one ever quits i buy another one
shine and is not too big nor is it too just the right size i was a little disappointed that
a month or two of heavy use i have a fishing boat at first i used some office chair but
too large for melting fix thought was perfect it not print on package says not recommended for use on polyethylene
say that used as recommended by customer service to repair leak in queen air mattress i decided to partially inflate
