the floor in the back seat i love having something convenient workable to keep trash off of the floor and
the hole is big enough to put things in but enough to keep them there the small piece of velcro

a mess when you pour and the leak around the plug is enough to allow residual oil in the pan
the pan sits for a while the opening is also such that at least on my cars for the first
they pull down properly had seals on both large and caps and plastic materials that did swell with oil exposure
one time and oil leaked from both the large and caps i finally had to pour the oil into another
you are supposed to tighten it down then open the plug to drain the oil into another container for disposal
after three oil changes i have thrown it out the cap cracked and broke and the large cap leaks when
with a large opening as this one opening is quite i made a mess when i used it as the
size i would either find something super large or stupid this is a great medium just to add the quality
the used oil level gets even with the pour spout cap and starts to leak even with the cap screwed

the inside a car or the house due to it size about the same surface area as a clothes iron
does need washing and only infrequent i was spending a fortune on swiffer duster replacements that did work as well

would happened from previous experience years ago it was a area so i was really concerned with it but decided
it even has a pocket to put money or other items in would really recommend this product this is a
is very limited for many homes these will be too do not order them without measuring the width first and
problem the structure seems sturdy but the magnets are very and weak it would not stick to my vent at
wet cloth not too bulky but large enough for most pieces of trash that would otherwise end up left lying
and bumped my knees the whole ride this one is enough that it is not a major nuisance also it
for my car i really like this one it is enough to put on the side of the seat so
using it to power a few lights and maybe a fan the unit does work and the alarm feature of
the under dash panel does not come out only a panel around the steering column comes out making exposure very
is the button arrangement on the remote i know the button is for both unlock and lock but everyone else
good for this type of item all parts and a installation tool kit are included except for any small relays
a small installation tool kit are included except for any relays that may be necessary for some door locks security

run a small tv but i have been using a on it for days now maybe about hours in total
however recommend an adapter attachment that will allow for pumping items such as life vests good value for money bought
they are in diameter and i checked they are too for the candle holder if you are going to advertise
purchased these candles if i had known they were so what is to say it a candle for camping they
they have enough length to reach between cars but are and flexible enough to fit into a very small space
even with the on the ends but the ends are enough so there no interference with other hardware the hitch
to the equipment in the car the rack is is enough that the vehicle plus rack could still fit in
wanted these to workout but the hole size is too for this bull ring these will rattle once installed but
stars on my previous review this fits well on my x trailer this is a very good product and fits
cons this net is absolutely completely utterly worthless for anything or light enough it wo stay in the bed on
my expectations very happy with my purchase it tightens up enough to fit my bed and if you have a
it the hooks are too thick to fit into the tow loops on smaller cars but generally you can find
the bottom of the barrel and suction tube contact the gap provided by the cut will still allow fluid in
more than i need for filling my skid steer and gallon tank for my shop heater but no more pumping
just fine not every tire store can mount tires this so a call before you haul your trailer around can
some frustration balancing seems to be also due to the size i learned this because they did not have a
have a balancing machine that would accommodate a tire this but they said it should not matter and so far
size the one thing i would recommend is getting another fountain pump to go down in the pond like i
and issues i had and they are unavoidable with a pond the pump clogs often and the water evaporates this
strap broke out of its hinge the strap was to to fit over the helmet no matter how i adjusted
would be a good idea to have a pair of lightweight goggles in my backpack for when the snow or
fleece lining covers everything and does a good fold up enough to go in the saddle bags so the helmet
it easily to carry with you the bag folds up for storage in your the price is right too this
to spend the extra for that protecting against scratches and bumps this bag does it for me also my helmet
for gloves extra shield or whatever it folds up reasonably as well a solid four star performance it cheap but
a charm now it not perfect there is still a little dent but you ca really even tell the dent
larger dents i ca attest to how it works with dings and dents but am guessing by that other products
cracked in best of luck very good for pulling out to not do as well on contoured surfaces were there
works really well on large dents did okay on a dent but did better on the large one i glad
one i glad i purchased this product i received a dent in the real of my car while parked in
glad i have this for future dents would recommend for dents it was a pretty big size tent and it
this item thank you i purchased this to fix several dents on my car some on doors some on hood
but did not the small dents one not purchase for dents waste of money i got a huge dent on
in them which might have been why i had a but noticeable x dent in the tank of the little
dent works great on large dents not too bad on dents but makes it so much better definitely worth the
hood needed to be replaced hood is fixed but the remaining dent is noticeable unless you are close to the
tries in minutes my inch dent was down to a inch dent i am not sure if it will get
dent i am not sure if it will get that of a dent out but it looks better than it
a bit of touch up paint and looks like a cart accident before was a crater soccer ball sized inches
product i wish that this same company made a for dents too i have dents on both sides of my
inches so it may not be able to fix the dents however if you are like me who do not
dents with it they should have included smaller ones for dents which is very common on vehicles this is a
inches in diameter although by pulling around the periphery of dents may pop them out anyway i suggest wetting surface
torque range is for those cautious this is not for jobs you might easily overtighten bolts with this i have
on and off road needs and these are perfect from to large batteries this thing juices them quick and the
but when i began to unload the chips only a portion came out leaving the majority in the truck i
fit to the tee enjoy item easy to install one problem this cover even thow it has elastic it would
one fit the but when it came it was too for the car the material repels water well and is
the and with room to spare it folds up in package for easy storage when not in use i use
the garage floor this covered my altima which is a car with no problems whatsoever it did get ripped when
my camry it appears to be a little bit too some parts on the sides are still exposed does completely
meguiar combo worked fantastically on my audi i used the buffing pad i had from the previous kit with a

the bolt hole on the main locking device is too and will have to be drilled to a bigger size
as the feed through hole for stud is way to for any stud that i have ever seen very cheaply
makes a quality plug for outboards as well as other engines hey makes sense nippon parts for nippon products my

smaller than it looks cheaply made only good for very jobs a a a a aa a it does the
also helps keep spillage to a minimum this is a funnel it will work for just abought any and easy
amazon does just what is required of it mainly for jobs like combining bottles very pleased this thing is smaller
funnel that comes in useful when filling gas tanks with openings also for hard to get to vehicle gas tanks
your transmission dip stick tube so it has to be enough so you can just dump a bunch a fluid
dump a bunch a fluid into it at once it and does hold all that much for what it is
advertised great for filling other items it fill sand into bags for a project at work works well i did
difference drip free is sooo nice i was for a funnel like this one it will serve my purposes exactly
use this for filling gas cans heaters lawn mowers atv gas cans and much much more the reason i am
i do use this funnel much since it a bit and only needed for places that are hard to reach
means but i think that they should have had a side note on the description that this would be best
best used on a however i will use it for liquids its a works like a funnel looks like a
reach items such as mowers utv etc good funnel best funnel yet great for changing oil in a small engine
best small funnel yet great for changing oil in a engine more words required they tell me now they are
other products around the house that require motor tip is enough to fit inside of most tight spaces and the

was paying for it the flo tool is a little but does the job for me whether putting oil in

for a small onboard battery charger to trickle charge a car king midget that does get driven enough to keep
battery completely charged so far it worked as advertised it and light weight so i was able to attach it
working so i am happy with this product good quality i use it with generator battery and it saved me
be trying them out when it warms up quality product size allows easy permanent mount under hood i have three
home to dead battery the charger works great it is permanently connected to car just plug in an electrical cord

cables then putting everything away when finished just mount this unit under your hood plug in a small ac extension

the other backup batteries they work great this product is and exactly what i needed to put on my i
the battery neither would work but this charger is so that i was able to lodge it snugly into the
automatic shutoff does not boil the water out of a battery like a larger charger or a manual charger can
battery in my pickup live just outside of a very town about a mile and a trip to town a
not installed in a vehicle which is to keep a battery fully charged at all times it is not necessary
the battery when the battery reaches full charge also the size is a plus which allows installation just about anywhere
this little charger does the job great it has a form factor and is designed to be permanently installed and
went bad within a year i use them to maintain tractor have another unit offered by this company that is
two dust covers come in the package along with a measure of grease to help prevent much can be said
loose from vibration even on rough roads i appreciate the tube of grease that comes with them i reckon they
after trying four bulkier splitters that would fit in the space around my outlet i just glad to have a
water for hours unlike the stock solid backed seats the holes in the back of these seats allow a breeze
your entire the incident ruined our trailer and our vacation price to pay for our safety but in retrospect i
real thick but it will bond things together and cover holes a very good product recommended by my son as
of stress on it never did break thanks had a plastic gas tank leak that was too large for melting
first place gets the job done if you have a trailer tongue you might run out of threads i did
want to invest in a dedicated sprayer for just this job also i was not sure that any small sprayer
this small job also i was not sure that any sprayer could do a good job so i was stuck
brief and clear i mixed the paint and used a container to carefully transfer it from the gallon can to
power units but they only i done spot repairs and spot paint blending on my boat very successfully but i
to go on satisfactorily it looked kind of from the beads of paint before it dried but it looks pretty
not worth considering i used this product many times on jobs and it is the best for the money the
and bought this to use on jobs that are too for setting up the full size sprayer i love this
the glass bottle for the sprayer is a nice for screws or nuts too very hard to get it to
waste of time and money these are great for those jobs husband only complain was that the propellant seemed to
fits the coupler lock for the ball was way toooo for my trailer ball says its fits a ball there
pulling into the garage my audi softtop is not exactly so it takes at least big towels to dry the
enough to wipe off the last remaining water it leaves streaks of water which is a big deal but wo
for of the car washers out there but for the amount that want their car literally spotless i recommend finding
practice also helps to prevent scratching of the surface when particles get trapped between the chamois and the paint surface
anything the absorbing is done so this is great for jobs i have a black car so i need to
and dry yourself off wash it once home with a amount of bleach do not dry it and put it
trailer it also fit on my bulldog hitch its a price to pay for added protection even if they only
my time and effort are worth so much more than premium in price that said my year old boat looks
too slowly because my hole in the foil was so another learned wear gloves so it does not get on
a fast cure is also available in but only the tubes time will be the true test of the product
the past and i know of nothing better bought the size because of its shelf life when opened sticks like
this one we are supporting american workers in our own way i ordered this one it is a needed the
ties from the backs of bicycle seats i simply drilled holes in the upper corners to let the zip ties
vehicles plenty of notice and reaction time compared to a red reflector they be great if i delayed and have
around they also do take up much storage space very but what do expect for price i would not really
garage to throw behind wheels and such during oil changes enough to not take up much space on the shelf
move on you need for each side works well for pop up buy these over ones rope and add your
is advertised this is a must have for med to trailers works well and holds fast and steady i am
i have receive wheel chocks in two days they are but will work for my trailer the package was and
when i work on it this chock is light and which is nice but the contour also hugs the wheel
work as advertised i bought these for use with a trailer hauling a utv i put my own ropes in
a rope that fits into holes my trailer is very with tires and they fit perfectly do know how long
with the purchase and i served very well for a car that i am building doing well on my lawn
unfortunately the mounting holes in my hitch attachement are too for this system shank size so i had to return
very easy to switch balls a coin key or a of stone or wood ball locks securely in place with
so that i could use my bike rack and a trailer the bikes caused interference so i added a extension
came without hardener bad news for someone who lives in town got this and was a little this product is
this is such a irresponsible way i only had a area to patch on my jeep so am glad that
made well another bonus is that it comes with a so it wo disappear one day very happy with my
and works great i would highly recommend it nice and but the numbers are quite legible the digits are hours
with all different sizes the product comes loose in a cardboard box price for the size and quantity was fine
of it this pump works ok if you have a engine like a lawn mower but if you have something
a good sized one for my needs i have a jet boat and it works great for when i do
is more or less expected my acura tl has a tab on the ceiling where you can clip your garage
be good to go great mirror if you have a boat with limited windshield allow me to watch the skiers
the mirror is just about right not too big or it does seem to get in the way too bad
grips tightly and does slip it packs up to a manageable size what not to like btw i using this
neatsfoot compound in many stores it a mixture of a amount of neatsfoot oil and petroleum based oils not the
the past i have used other cleaners that have left scratches in the plastic i have used this product on
price and does its job on teak furniture bottle is but just enough for an seat picnic table great enhancement

not cost too much so it is worth it this but functional waste basket performs well for me i like
bottom keeps it in place i used to use a shopping bag from the harley dealer as my trash bag
a clean car this is the perfect size for a vehicle it does not get in the way of passengers
but two things i do like one it a little for my taste two it needs some way to weight
on the internet and found this litter bag it sounded but i ordered it for a try it is wonderful
back make sure small is what you after really really this is great for floor by back seat but i
and am relatively neat this trash can is still too much smaller than it looks in the picture once it
clean so far it worked the trash bin is quite roughly a cube with the weight in it but honestly
hard cornering overall i am quite pleased with it really but i have had any leaks i read the dimensions
did not want a garbage can we just wanted a unobtrusive container for light trash such as candy wrappers used
really like it yes as other reviews say it is but i knew this since i read the dimensions for
i bought this despite some of the reviews of being i could find dimensions anywhere so here they are h
more than what i got the trash bin is so i ca believe i paid for it if you put
you have in your car in my car i have water bottles other drink containers an occasional fast food bag
i need to empty the trash i also added a strip of velcro to the bottom to give it a

in our serves the purpose well and is perfect for trash this can sets on the hump very well and
what you need either i love this trash can it enough to be out of the way but large enough
easily i like this little trashcan while it is quite and will not hold a lot of garbage definitely more
neat does slide around on the floor it is very but holds everything we put in it will probably order
a nice little trash bag well made and sturdy just i should have read the description it just looked bigger
keeps it from moving around overall it works good just but i guess you would want so much trash sitting
or would pour liquid in this trash bin is so it has a nice design and i like the weighted
been very useful and never tips over but it is as people have said and it getting smaller all the
the clear plastic pocket gives you a place to put notes that you need to keep handy so that works

for my dogs while attending trials i can run a portable fan all day and still have power left at

bland and uninspiring more often than not this is a complaint believe another tiny complaint that affect the rating i
good adventure playing link awakening while just looking at a game boy screen if you get into this game it
little handheld and it proves that even though gb is it can still compete with the bigger and better systems

there the nostalgic game is great especially because of its learning curve and awesome replay value the best next to
color one of which is that the console is too for me i have big fingers so it hard for
difficult to play without the pack because it is too to hold on to this isnt bad i have it
everywhere game boy color is the best had a couple scratches on screen but does affect came play so it
you works perfectly no dust in it at all only screen scratches but over all it looks unused besides the
with it is the buttons are to close and too which causes a problem for people with big hands like
game boy color and i love it it is so and light to carry around and it looks great the
size of the body makes it good for big and hands would recommend to new and vets to gaming i
long car rides or vacations the screen is kind of but what it lacks in screen size it makes up
are playing the games even though the screen is very you still get a lot of detail and i like
on alec empire punk a possession it highly desirable it stylish and easy to hold and apart from the fragile
i purchased was in great condition with only a few scratches on the screen cover but all bottoms are fully
super mario deluxe and tetris dx the two classics it enough to put in your jacket pocket and the game
making it much larger altogether i had also forgotten how and thin the gbc system is it is smaller than

this game is great it firsts starts out as a group called avalanche that try to stop a powerful company
what okay but to my it was their was a crack on the cover as it stated but either than

because it would give too much away but here a sample of what the game has to start as cloud
have the fast paced intense storyline that had its the things too like being able to just head over to
the modern consoles and for a seven game that no feat what remains today is one of the best storylines
whats gon na happen the same is true for the menial that are supposed to bring out more of a
this game also wont end quickly you start in a city then an area then you have the whole globe
a little more sloppy than it was intended to another criticism comes with its characters while they memorable they often
killing me now then onto why the game has many flaws that stop it from recieving what you all think
it also can subtract from your stats the story starts as a rebel group avalanche fighting the shinra corporation that
are a seasoned player but the positive details override these everything looks real locations and characters are perfectly realised and
survival horror make veronica so great the graphics are no part sure i reveled like the rest of us in
the game just did seem quite right but that a complaint and one of the few small things i did

levels because the whole game is one big level with loading screens but you backtrack whenever you want which is

the other font they use is too intricate and too to read and i still dont know what half the
