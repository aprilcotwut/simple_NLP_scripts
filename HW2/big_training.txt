they are slightly smaller than the oem decals not a deal just a little each letter is an individual piece
it for a friends car looks great and isnt a recomend this if you want it for a subtle not
as advertised but rather and very low quality way too for back window where i am replacing a worn receipt

when i have a problem or if it fails these wire cables are the best ones i seen around they
car battery died we got a from someone with a truck he looked at our light duty booster cables and
that we should get cables in case someone with a truck jumped us light duty cables are not meant for
have to start jumping vehicle to start coach they a gauge that long and made in america a perfect set
can buy some cheap gauge or whatever at your local box store but i have personally been in situations where
lines are needed to prevent this amperage is also a consideration the more amps a load pulls the more resistance
years that i owned them these jumper cables are quite and heavy because of their gauge that makes it a
to copper jaws like some cables do but not a round trip voltage drop down the jumper cable itself feet
buy cheap cables again the only down side not that of a deal is that these are rather heavy which
my needs i wanted the extra length because with a truck you never know how your vehicles will be situated
tried to put it together but tried to put the end into the small end it stripped the was really
this for our new ridgid which amazon does sell the box store i bought it from noted it was in
a new sophisticated car with lots of electronics and a battery bmw lexus mercedes etc i suggest cables instead these
for hours the battery does go dead now he too and his little sister is driving it on the original
car for minutes plenty of power once went around yhe block two times we bought this for our sons jeep
could use the the girls are and and are too for the jeep i was skeptical that the battery was
through the ringer with dents on every corner and just enough for the battery no bubble wrap or anything to

reviewers state it leaks from both caps will make a mess wherever you put it i give this a zero
cumbersome to clean up it a great idea but the lid on top is difficult to get screwed on correctly
the nearest recycling center i got it from a local box retailer as it is a bit cheaper than amazon
can take my old oil to autozone or it a plastic bowl lol does the job and the price was
to pick up the can as much the spouts are and nice looking but the one i have leaks around
it would take a month or so for delivery no deal the carriers were for an ongoing project and time
speed drill which gives it the torque needed to drive screws and other tasks that require a powerful drill this
have electric heat you will probably need at least this of a generator it might be pushing it trying to
the sphere inside the moon should be red not a deal really when it comes to product quality as for
durable worth the money this works great because of the wheels it can roll over cords and other things that
a small wheeled creeper would dave great creeper i a guy and it works well and is pretty comfy the
and i can fit on it with no problems the wheels make all the difference when rolling around and under
ones i normally buy and then get upset is very and i did get the off road see it lasting
creeper seems good quality so far it has a pretty footprint compared to other creepers ive used but it hasent
it is that what the gas filter is for anything enough to clog the carb would have gotten caught in
it happens from pushing it on the valve stem no deal though i just push the lip back into the
it off even my repair kit screw driver was too what more the middle section is little more than an
on the tire stem very easily and the numbers are for easy reading you ca go wrong if you purchase
had to a couple of times but is absolutely no deal to do at all i would recommend these to

new one but i did expect it to be so it will work for tvs no matter i like it
them line risky junk no returns i used before a skil polisher of and i thought that to polish a
nut that was to do by hand the tool is and heavy no doubt about it but not or too

they dropped over on someone i knew that was a fan of commercial chemical sprays he thought he had to
new house and sprayed it down with air freshener disinfectant name he died shortly are being nerve with chemical sprays
nut or oil pan nut for oil change basically any nut you can all ready reach and view with no
can get same results with cheaper model and its too and bulky for anything else this is great if you

most seemed to suggest a rack one of the two rack makers i really was installing a roof rack or
it and say i did see it loops are barely enough to fit the rubber coated hooks from ratchet straps

it seems to help keep them clean i use the ones for the outside of the car and small ones
dash and console to make the car look better the one works just as well on the exterior ive had
did let i have to say this just like it brother the original works like a charm for anyone having
seeing these things all over the place in my local box auto shops wal mart etc so save yourself some

cleaning head the one on this page has a nice cleaning head and i was almost reluctant to get the
fall into the ashtray with all the ashes creating a mess you have to dig thru ashes and cigs to
a part broken off and rattling around in the too anyway a diameter was given so i should have ordered
epoxy or something stronger tried this on a small and dent and it did not reduce either dents after i
on the compressor surge where it dropped to it is and bulky and i would recommend a transfer box if
it and i am very pleased with live on the island of hawaii and it is reassuring to knew what

charger i bought this charger based solely on the advertisement mistake it a very short time and both the clamps
in it that makes a whirring noise but its no deal if you are drawing a lot of power it
selection of cd in my car without digging through a binder of them or something i recommend the straps do
because the first i bought have done a terrific job plus in the usa love the air deflector works great
heat was pointed were warmer i priced similar items at box stores and did find anything this well made and
out the night this fixed the problem these make a difference if you have central air so far i have
small enough so that it not in the way but enough to take care of most trash that you encounter
have been in many cars with litter that were too and bumped my knees the whole ride this one is
that will wear away in a couple months not a deal im just happy its never stopped working for me
unlock and lock but everyone else seems to think the button with the key on it is unlock cant blame
unlock it and end up starting the car not a deal but the keys could have been maybe a little
return to vendor from places like wally world or the orange giant back then there was home depot builder square
you the number of rtv we had dealing with the box boys because of the lack of intelligence of the
through the instructions he told me it would be too of a job for him and that he could do
on for their full time limit fortunately these are not issues and i happy with the unit performance after about
when the carrier is installed now it looks like a boss with this extension i see other suvs out there
i have asthma and the occasional cough that is no deal in the office is a death sentence in a
noticeably easier to lock this may not seem like a deal if you have never had a receiver lock but
long enough to tell be forewarned this lock is sooo i have trouble hooking my safety chains to the hitch
or canoes on top your rig you not hauling the boat and you only want to take the one vehicle
but a great value they are heavy though not a deal i feel like i overpaid a little but they
to get them in without binding but that was no deal the only complaint were the screws the head slots
i was worried that the waterfall was going to be enough but it perfect just the right size the one
price strap could be more comfortable but it not a deal checked walmart and they do have anything cheaper delivered
skiing googles they the perfect size i might have a nose that creates a rather large gap between the googles
a great helmet bag the bag is lines with fur and note due to the center zipper it can at
space can be used to carry other items bag is enough for hemet gloves and a quality is appropriate for
storage i expect my helmet to look new for years enough to fit a helmet with a visor and it
hood there were a lot of them and they were but i was able to get about of them fixed
had two big dints on driver side i had one on my driver door and driver rear door both dints

strong enough to pull the dent out i not that it definitely pulled the dents out it was very easy

have are strong this item worked so well on the dent put into my vehicle by a shopping cart unfortunately
little gadgets prices are bad either anyway i pulled the dent out of my car with tug and did my
easily it is worthy for me thanks i had a dent on my bumper with this tool i was able
dents would recommend for small dents it was a pretty size tent and it worked great pulled the tent right
several car dents and the suction cup it way to to pull most dents it would only work for very
want to warn you that the dent puller is rather about inches so it may not be able to fix
good reviews without much confidence that it would remove a dent in the rear of our we were pleasantly surprised
when it pulled out the dent and saved us a bill at the body repair shop we strongly recommend this
attached than when a reading is taken just after no deal as long as it consistent just add lbs of
on seems to be psi so it is not a problem just what i was looking for perfect i wish
doubt you have enough tarp for very many or very folds wheel is cheap plastic and if you hit a
the hood started to fall apart the material looked threadbare rips appeared leading to even bigger rips i sent photos
only draw back is that the outter hole is not enough to let the lug come through it it has
a cfm fan in my hot rod helping the modified block keep cool i use the switch to operate the
a sturdy large funnel but it is not sturdy yes no opening is not inches barely inches or so this
these on construction equipment and it saves money in a way if you keep the battery from going flat they
old car and loves it as well recommended to anybody fan of this little device my wife range rover tends
enough to start at below zero like it was no will be ordering a second for an other vehicle worked
amp charger keeps the battery charged unit is a little to mount in the engine compartment of most of todays
are the kit comes with a wire harness lights and zipties they zipties are definitely big and i did have
wire harness lights and big zipties they zipties are definitely and i did have issue using them to attach to
my ram it keeps it shine and is not too nor is it too small just the right size i
it to me too i really appreciate that with the of july coming up this weekend i will be back
yes after receiving it i noticed that the is too on it and when you go to lock it the
the round patch i made i made the patch that to ensure adhesion on a possible seep leak but after
to match a custom latex ceiling paint after asking the box paint department salesperson whether i needed to prime the
strip an medallion to repaint it next trip to the box resulted in different advice should have put on a
a non issue i am on the way to the orange box store cheaper there to buy as many as
that said all the locks work great there is a advantage to key for all the minor point but the
had to order a extension cable but not a a deal sent it back too much of a gap between
the side holes no good easy to install not too in size illuminates very well this is an excellent safety
washing your car and this gets the job done the sell for me is having a place to put it
for you can clean your car your bike your other things of super grandeur or cut it in half and
the dirt if it smooth and not sticky or dirt deal just relax calm down go to bed and tomorrow
their car as another reviewer noted these are at local box stores for around the same price if you include
softtop is not exactly small so it takes at least towels to dry the top this product not only makes
water it leaves small streaks of water which is a deal but wo be acceptable to a perfectionist my friends
figured it was worth a shot it big twice as as you need really and it made of this feeling
water around its actually soaks it right up it so you do even have to ring it out often works
off my dog and it did a good job plenty for most jobs this might sound bizarre but i decided
no were near as good as the original what a step down in quality hard barely absorbant easy tears easy
much like a natural chamois when dry this size is enough to make carboy cleaners in i used one of
to dry my car basically all it did was make water beads into smaller ones make the smaller beads into
easy to get into tiny crevices in the doors and enough to fling it on top of my truck since
able to keep it wet without going sour is a plus i have used this product for a few years
a bit difficult for my wife to make that first step it does extend back though which makes the and
people do park as close in fear of hitting the bully great product and worth every penny this is a
thought i give maguiar a try based on their advertising mistake will never use again it is no better than
very spotty and streaky with that said always been a meguiar guy save youself some time and buy the meguiars
wax leaving a cleaner it far easier to do a rv in less time then flagship wax i found flagship
maintains flex so well but removing it can be a undertaking due to it great permanent sealing i tell everyone
boots size neoprene dive boots size waders all seams feet patches on knees size large long neoprene dive gloves size
and do know anything esle i can say its a chunk it keeps my junk from rolling away what more
wheel chock at a very good price i had a order so shipping was free too there are more expensive
my spree i found a ac cover plate at a box retailer and replaced a solid ac plate on a
for anything to heavy but if your hauling something that you would be using a bumper ball anyways the mechanism
need to worry if it will come off beats the lug sided ball hitch imho like many people i am
hitch plugs but this one gets the most compliments seemed to me until it was installed then it looked perfect
and purchased a new one which is built much better thumbs down on this product i am very disappointed only
gauge shows the gauge reads about volt low not a deal as it more for telling me the battery is
my tongue gave the back of the suction cup a sloppy lick plunked it right back into place i wiggled
people in backseat of my sedan while is awesome nice and very suction cup is nice and strong and has
year and the mirror stays in place it a pretty mirror but it does block your view if you mount
use is not for a boat but to cover a blind spot in a beach a passenger open golf cart
hours need a mirror but do want to pay a price this is the get we ordered this for our
this is the get we ordered this for our honda red and was not disappointed stays put on the windshield
cup is great and even stays on when going over wakes with my boat which can be quite a jarring
size of the mirror is just about right not too or small it does seem to get in the way
with it much better than i had hoped for nice mirror with clear distortion free view this thing has stuck
suction cup works great but the size is a little for what i wanted needed something to help me down
i bought this to use in my car as a mirror to see my child but it wo stick to
waxing a boat so lets just say it makes a suck a much littler suck have been using this product
carrier almost as much as my jeep with a trunk enough to fit a pair of socks if you fold
the past this really is a minor thing in the picture great in keeping outdoor christmas lights untangled used for
well hole may be universal but this switch is too to fit the tiller location on a johnson outboard i
can be jarred out of adjustment when you hit some waves had no idea how much i was missing this
not work for me the mirror itself is very sturdy and easy to see it did not work for me
this was a huge we are talking scare your neighbors almost had to move my canopy up big did i
your neighbors big almost had to move my canopy up did i say it was big side mirrors they are
move my canopy up big did i say it was side mirrors they are a little crazy and take getting
my had to place above my windshield it was so great adjustable side wing mirrors can see the whole run
like is the simple windshield mounting bracket that has a knob for easy repositioning on the window frame the bracket
the scraper on the handle which happens a bit no deal the snow removal broom is a great tool it
is going to cause of the steering wheel not a deal and i just turn my steering wheel so the
the one for a truck is huge and is too for a car how long does it last i have
on the dashboard it very lightweight and has a nice screen it also illuminates with the touch of a button
only thing you can bump on the front are the illumination set this clock will not get bumped off it
it settings easy to hit the backlight with gloves on and easy to read at a glance too uses one
wide wrong it x they say it lighted wrong it numbers are easy to read but the clock is not
little clock seems to keep time pretty well display is and it easy to read in the daytime i wish
stick it or lean it anywhere and the readout is and bright i would highly recommend it for price and
great hopes for this one anyway it just as described display love that i can get it to alternate date
recommending this product i use while driving and makes a difference this did work at all for me i had
back now if i still this set is definitely a step up in quality from working with a square and
who is always barefoot at home the mat made a difference right away well worth every dollar in fact i
i would buy this again i prefer it over its brother due to its size great product it was everything
if needed put a piece of foam on it no deal it the entry level model and it great you
the farmer from down the road stopped to investigate this box in the brush best creeper ever get one today
safe update deer alert blew out after i hit a pothole no doubt from smashing into the on my than
cold as he wants and this blanket does the trick enough so that it wraps all around you heats almost
my mom is comfortable it works great and solved a problem the blanket does not have a switch or a
it cold enough to use this thing it nice and it easily fits over my lap with spare fabric to
it does get as warm as i expected it is enough for two to use in a compact car and
in two weeks it is also a very nice size enough to cover both but not so big that it
nice size big enough to cover both but not so that it is bulky or in the way i would
up very fast and keeps me nice and warm definitely enough for two normal sized adults you would think this
bad reviews works just like it was advertized it very and easy to wrap up in cheaper than the for
seat from the front outlet and the blanket itself is enough for two people total satisfaction works perfectly everything ok
mirrors in fact the blade on this unit is so that unless the curvature of your windshield is just right
not delayed due to scraping ice most of the time chunks come right sweet it almost seems that the ice
was plenty tall enough and a camry is not a car i was having to lean up against the car
look at you as crazy but once they see the daddy scraper in action they will come to you amaze
the carpet i bought these instead of the was a mats soon lost their molded fit and they do contain
didnt have to wait over the weekend the box was and had my small filter in it great shipping great
the same power performance sound and economy i not a car guy by any means but i enjoy a clean
but no the caps pop out easily which is no deal but that just increases time and last the fit
i would recomend k n to anyone thanks such a filter works great noticed a little more power and better
the product and highly recommend buying anything from lund not enough an excellent over the hump small waste container it
of tissues product says leakproof which is nice not too just what i was looking for it small but it
floor does tip does leak and while small it is enough to hold trash in between the great idea is
you not into measurements think however you measure it it enough to hold the litter for an afternoon outing but
bigger size this was just what i needed not very at all it fits perfectly behind the center console in
and was a little concerned that it might be too but it is the item was actually very satisfactory owing
so it can hold all of their pads it is enough that they can get things in and out easily
been ripped off and was no where to be a deal but worth mentioning the old pilot really appreciated new
the plugs should be changed changing the plugs made a difference in performance and smoothness my vehicle is a honda
on a vacation trip to np where it was a hit we have given one as a christmas gift to
off some impacts are used in heavy industry for as as your fist and can deliver ft pounds but can
got it for my dad for christmas he has a buick with lots of trunk space so the organizer is
extra steps to keep it really clean smelling are no deal and worth the extra effort it worked for a
of a second or so to bring online not any deal but a small moment of start up wait after
just have to have some monster cables and connections a fuse is suggested all in the owners manual the manual
fans seem less powerful than an outlet but not a lights work great and yes my coffee with it and
getting a soft green and white rug that was really and that is not at all what i got this
a spare tire cover for his camper and is a fan this product is of very limited use does provide
or before road trips being careful not to overcharge no deal the several times i needed it to actually jump
rating is true cars battery condition will also play a role in whether or not this can boost you enough
to use in our shop the rubber housing is a plus as the equipment is moved around often and will
size but the smell of the ozium itself is a give away so if you are looking to get rid
you are looking to get rid of smell without the that you used an air freshener look somewhere else but
easy to open nothing sounded broken good size not to looks just like the pic i plug it in the
car battery but i do think it it dry it so hard to find a place for it if you

our portable dvd player on the hour drive up to sur ca hello micro inverter saved the day the sound
ancient stereo does really work the thing is sort of and ugly but here the bottom line it worked without

five days and recharging four cell phones daily its a lead acid battery in the shape of an old eighties
camping we definitely drained it out but it was a help in the primitive no power site we had it
this the wiring was a little short but not a deal the air pressure sensor is adjustable so you can
trailer behind me i am actually excited about hauling a load with that trailer now just to watch my worker
ton truck the ride is already stiff so not that of a difference i highly recommend these bought these air
holes to make them fit better which was not a deal the part that took the longest was on the
just the way i wanted them and they make a difference in the look of any truck you put them
and all the snaps are in great shape but a gust of wind snapped the frame at every corner this

it looked like now this was before the internet was so i was left to wonder and hopelessly look in
library book sale so they all have library binding a step above this bright shiny addition but this will complete
be dug up throughout the text sure this book tackles subjects in a small clear way but how many children
folk great thank you and adds it is almost too and wonderful for small animal brains to understand but we
that itself the nativity really means is indeed almost too a thing to explain any explanation would need to resort
this book about frank mahovlich is well worth reading the m was one of the best and players of all
ways and the various other coaches and players that the m played for and against a great read for all
two more with the alongside the biographical narrative of the m is the author experience of going on the road
this book provides an inside look as well as a picture of one of canada most influential figures my imagination
conveying the sense of what it was like for the m throughout his development from a child of immigrants to
my kindle edition which was distracting but not really a deal this man has a definite gift for writing i
the adventures of peg series peg likes things that are and best and this time she decides to climb mt
truly amazing and much more than it appears in the to sara gruen for filling the book with accurate details
forty pages fell out luckily i already read them no deal it probably had to do with the sun and
like qualities understanding pain anger empathy happiness all from her brown the story i felt all of the emotions rosie
this was an interesting story great characters i not a circus fan but this story really drew me in i
and entertaining because i remember the traveling circuses with the top tents and the intriguing side shows which as a
again her tale of life for jacob under the mangy top is rivoting the only problem with it is you
i saw that this was a good read at the books a million down the street but i could afford
in a very small minority that does see what the deal is or maybe it was because i was in
novel will engage all your senses you will see the top and hear the guys pounding in the stakes you
if perhaps a bit fanciful a grand book about the top do miss it i dislike strange sexual behavior but
a soft spot for elephants and had compassion for this one plus it is a wonderful well written love story
off we went to the clyde beatty circus under the top water for elephants brought these memories back as though
much of the book was about his experience in the top tent circus if someone does care for letter cuss
just part of the flavor of the people in the top he dislikes being treated like a senile man by
minded man i was glad to hear more about the top circus that my father used to go see as
right now and say that i do not understand the hype for this book i liked it it was interesting
elephant named rosie symbolism that is not overtly contrived the circus in the sky is captivating but there is an
a red flag to those readers who like me are fans of profanity i listened to water for elephants on
intrigued when the movie came out i never been a fan of books made into movies but the story sounded
told an enchanting story and not just because of the top magic that the circus brings a wonderful read running
serviced by exotic dancers illusions and duplicity are the moral tent under which circus performers enchant depression men and women
then not the darker side of circus life after the top closes down this is a love story a life
beginning to end the information about life working for the top is entertaining and absorbing drama excitement hardship and a
read i felt like i was standing next to the top through the whole book get it read it and
and strong affirmation that henceforth there will be no more tops rodeos dog fights animal races bull fights or any
seventy years again i found myself lured into the book top to find that secret and much like an carnival
i gave it four as stars because i not a fan of all the sexual preference the storytelling goes back
to his to our love interest marlena to our antagonist al the story focuses more on the circus life than
guarantee you will be unable to hold back from a belly laugh right out loud please get this book you
economic and social gloom enveloping the rubes that loved the top for the price of admission they could forget the
story you do feel like anything was left o none enough to comment i highly recommend this book a great
more comprehensive than water for was also disappointed with a loose thread in the plot where camel was to be
away to join the circus in the days of the top there were lots of menial jobs that kept those
on earth as the rail cars read this is the time it just surviving by staying one step ahead of
the light of a flickering lantern amidst the folds of top canvas as you roll on through the night to
jacob finds himself once again at the gates of the top and is given a chance to go home once
has moment similar to the the notebook and the movie fish i recommend it for anyone who enjoys historical fiction
heartbreaking the book uses the same narrative device as little man that is a very old gentleman remembering the exciting
circuses this book is more than a history of the top and most definitely more than a mere a young
that after all gruen shows the seedy side of the top the desperate times of the depression the multilayered personalities
but put up and take down the tents for the top day in and day out endlessly working like dogs
first hand how life was for those who lived the top life marvelous talent for a writer if she were
i encourage others to read it even if they arent readers i was genuinly surprised how quickly i read this
lucky that it has benefitted from great marketing and a budget film as there are other books which are more
author did a lovely job of handling so many characters and small she kept solid control over their little quirks
well graphic at times and i never again enter the top without feeling some compassion for the roustabouts the performers
work in the circus during the and when all the circuses were traveling the united states then this is a
the best stories out there right now i normally not on circus stuff but this book is an exception as
far entertaining and easy to read i am not a fan of love stories without foundation but i think overall
the people in this book gruen takes you through the tent into the strange and secretive world of the circus
story would be any good you are in for a surprise it no wonder this book has almost star it
americana sara gruen has created an entertaining novel under the top of the traveling circus cutting in and out of
that enabled me to picture how everything appeared in a top circus during that time you immediately connect with jacob
or several to quench its soon as i saw the top cover i was even more interested i read once
would sail right past the average person and were a deal to is almost always hard for me to initially
if the characters were not portrayed as beautifully on the screen as i have them in my mind i would
never been attracted to all that goes on under the top and if i did want to attend a circus
show you things you never imagined that happen outside the top so if you are going to buy one book
troupe beautiful acrobats tortured clowns animals with personalities almost as as their trainers and sometimes bigger the details are excellently
authentic setting and making you feel you are under the top it is sometimes shocking sometimes painful always compelling do
as the story am not sure if i am a fan of the old jacob not that it is bad
escapes from a nursing home to once again join the author shifts between jacob memories of circus life and his
that i truly did not think i like not a fan of circuses i just did think it would interest
place where there exists so happiness and unity of a happy family lifestyle to our deception she reveals the face
and what became of him after his years under the leaving cornell jacob made his way onto the benzini brothers
in her writing there are villians heroes sequined angels drunks hearted dwarves and smart quirky animals in all a virtual
world of the circus and its camaraderie life under the top sara gruen writing transports the reader back to a
when people who had very little hope could still dream and love fiercely i read this book in a few
recommended read what an amazing book i am not a fan of fiction but managed to finish this book within
you in and makes you never want to leave the top sometimes reading a book you wonder about editorial decisions
the circus this book will transport you back to the top the sights the sounds and the smells of the
for the day i dreamed that i was under the top i also could not get out of my mind
to know about the history and operation of the traveling top circus this is a well researched work and is
kept my attention throughout learned some facts pertaining to a top circus water for elephants was an excellent book detailing
younger times when i went to the circus under the top i really only purchased this book on my kindle
this book was made to be way more of a deal then it actually is water for elephants is one
time without handlers why would rosie be chained in the tent during a show one of the primary editorials states
this book as much as i did i not a fan of the circus or elephants but something made me
carry out his orders to kill me honor meets the there is any criticism of this book it is not
mom all the glitter and i experienced personally under the top and in gruen novel was right on her historical
i have no doubt this book is destined for the screen very soon water for elephants by sara gruen book
will be on that list i never really been a circus fan reading about them or attending them but i
in form a memoir novel similar in structure to little man elderly man looking back on his early adventures in
quarter or third of the story look elsewhere i not on summer reads or romance novels if you are you
the twisted and manipulative animal trainer for the al the boss of the benzini brothers makes a habit of visiting
i felt no connection to the characters at all the surprise ending was totally unbelievable the end wrapped up too
and being unloaded the activities and the action in the top displayed at the museum was a great refresher for
say that i was not disappointed and am now a fan of sara for elephants is a heart warming love
transcends and finds universal connections life is performing in the top we are all players we struggle with good and
a traveling circus going to town after town with the top acts the freak shows and the menagerie of exotic
whiplash so obviously he and jacob are destined for a showdown which amazingly is pulled off by the author without
i picture rosie the smiling elephant soaking everyone with a blast of water causing characters like blackie diamond jim pete
party angry accusation by a is being rewarded with a hollywood movie starring reese witherspoon ahh american pop culture with
but it about the circus in the early years the stadium circuses we see story is narrated by a old
two wise decisions in the story a starting with the event that the rest of the story leads up to
throats horse people i know questioned it a horse is and powerful and would be frightened not likely to let
than that i know too little about life under the top to comment on the depiction of events other than
away important plot points but i did not see the twist coming i surprised i did as all the signs
plain nasty acting people the circus did not play that of a role in this book the book more on
book is finished one can smell the popcorn and the top this book is definitely worth the read the story
hopeful dreams we all conjure up when we visit the top i loved this book it was so sweet in
to find this story of love and betrayal under the top one of the most engaging tales i read in
three of my sisters they all loved it i a fan my book club read and discussed this book a
the head with it throw in murder sex and a elephant wearing pink sequins and you have a fab book
you done landed yer ass on a circus boy a top rivaling the ringling brothers and headed by tyrannical ringmaster
from elephants to apes to zebras to horses to the cats like lions and tigers they even had polar bears
the parade of elephants and the setting up of the tent this book will inform you of what went on
yes i aging myself now i cast them for the screen this book read like butter i gave the book
the world of the people who are part of the show this was another book that you can picture all
one of the worst ones and unless you are a circus fan the most boring book as well this book
my kindle down such a great story i not a reader of fiction but i so enjoyed this book and
canada various misfits that magically come together during under the top the striptease shows that went on in such circuses
gruen makes the days when the circus was still a event come to things make this story stand out first
than glamorous what wonderful characters and the plot is one top thrill after the other i will be very surprised
wait to see how it is played out on the screen this is a must read if you are looking
book about a circus it a naturalistic look at the top and all that goes on under and around it
decided to read water for elephants now i am a fan the writing is clear and engaging the story is
for the curling theme for my girlfriend who is a fan of the sport i just sorry i did not
honor unlike many contemporary books fwtbt does not have a overwhelming climax instead the ending unfolds in a way that
while i was thinking get on with it already the one however that ruined the book for me was the
for him is that he may have lost one leg deal to me in throwing all that away and committing
this review by stating that i have never been a fan of war novels secondly i would definitely not classify
and a bitter vengeful enemy etc in other words one ball of paradox many reviewers have criticized hemingway characters for
writer we need in our times he focuses on the important issues without cynicism and never shies from exposing what
a great and therefore a great railed in his about cowboy who thought he could lead these tender men to
maria love in the face of impending not usually a romance guy at least in the books i read but
organized for nothing except party politics i say thrust a slice of over the whole underside of our industrial system
needs it also inspiring to see careful patient observation yield scientific payoffs this is a wonderful book that brought me
of renoir life from his son perspective i am a fan of the impressionist and renoir is without a doubt
its one of the best of its kind not too but with everything you want to know about the development
market highly recommended grady harp december another of de medici unwieldy books of gorgeous pictures of italian scenery paired with
because she likes to hit the sometimes she not a reader so i wound up reading it myself and it
because i thought it would be devoted to the quot picture quot only however it turned out to be a
vibrancy of his attitude of quot quot towards this wonderful cat makes me wonder if he is really a cougar
asian wife and how he felt it was just one thrill after another to be free from the western idea
the asian women whom he saw as part of a amusement park that he had fun with but little commitment
part vii of the book contents as he reviews the thinkers who established the legacy of anarchism its ends and
and recent events may be inevitable a history of a idea causes the weight of a big book but anyone
history of a big idea causes the weight of a book but anyone who read shorter works such as colin
you will enjoy it this was a i am a fan of morris west but had forgotten the story in
reader in the same way and to me there a difference between the is one of my favorite books ever
greatest books that i have ever read it was a accomplishment being that it was over pages even though it
fantasy mostly and if i reading history i usually reading giant books like rise and fall of the third reich
beginning herman wouk massive epic winds of war was a challenge for me it sat on my bookshelf for a
to be jewish other encounters are with historical people including names from wwii hitler stalin churchill and fdr no matter
easier to read on the kindle as it is a heavy highly recommend it to anyone who loves wwii drama
the eyes of this tight knit american it a pretty book the pages fly by really i old enough to
lifestyle next thing you know they be spotted at a disappointment sorry to say almost every major thriller plot has
one that just made me sad this one is pretty on military history the names have been changed to suit
author and the mauritius command demonstrates this thoroughly we are fans of the volumes patrick auther we love jack aubrey
the dispatches after a victory may not sound like a deal but the captains of such ships were often feted
the most famous of the custer defeat at the little flashman does spend all his time he would much rather
abound as flashy takes part in the battle of little horn being rescued by his indian of the flashman novels
most of his hair from the battlefield of the little horn i love this entire series but in my opinion
right in the midst of the battle of the little horn i found the first part more entertaining and the
times alive the height of the action is the little horn seen through the terrified but wily eyes of flashman
kit carson and riding among the american cavalry at little from uproarious fun and games the flashman series is set
still a fine book and recommended in the end the story is but with a sf reading this today i
to illustrate that mars is a planet and planets are yah i knew that guns under the table could have
witchita so falls witchita firebird sting brand new am a fan i just could get into this one the pacing
of kim stanley robinson books i ever read i a fan and thought the cover interesting i read the back
mars quot and the other two books in the series mistake halfway through the book and bored to tears i
and after some time reading mars sounds just as a empty stage for a pointless series of events that can
all be easily foreseen after pages for that matter had expectations for this book but it just a below average
this one but if you like carefully stories full of ideas on big stages then buy the whole trilogy right
if you like carefully stories full of big ideas on stages then buy the whole trilogy right now you will
is no longer the case it may not be a deal to most readers but it is to me i
you can read it at the correct pace not expecting things to happen all the time it very enjoyable this
as here in the mars books if you are a fan of an unbridled free market capitalism which by its
are two main drawbacks to this book that are pretty first off is the pace it can be agonizingly slow
must torture yourself and read it all yourself bring a box of no or some other such red mars is
yourself flying across oceans on ships underwater or in the city it will keep your attention and you will not
builds up so well and then prepares you for the events in the second final hundred pages move so quick
novels but it certainly worth the read if you a john clark fan i read and without remorse so many
keep the reader in the story and well am a fan of tom clancy you will like him tell you
doing something with the cia i mean it is a action pack thriller the ending is what brings it all
the series amazingly enough jack ryan does not play a role in this book but none the less tom clancy
a such as first clancy s books besides there is suspense and it give ideals clancy describes her as a
seemed to be panned by many but hey i a john clark fan remorse is a worthy addition to clancy
they are five when pam kelly girlfriend finally bites the one there is no sadness in it kelly wife had
her troubled childhood and why she ran off to the city and eventually resorted to prostitution to get by of
world let me start by saying that i not a clancy fan i read some of his stuff but i
out that stephen king himself rates her she did a interview with him in england it on the net hey
strange looking woman pushes a baby filled stroller under josh rig when josh stops dumbfounded and horrified by what has
dany and sam was i disappointed in the end yes time possible spoiler ahead i got a lot of back
worried what happened to others and still waiting for the any battle still loved it i only sad because of
wife pamela the fifth one for this i owe them time the debate may rage about how good a writer
than the beginning and ending books but where martin erred time was in taking so long to write this book
this has dragged on way too long and is a disappointment at best only got through the first pages then
think that we are still very far from seeing the picture and as some have pointed out it appears we
read hard cover books it hurts my wrists holding the tomes open as well as my body as the sharp
traveling it especially confusing because martin said one of the reasons he had trouble finishing the book was his meereenese
truly accomplished and we do get closer to the anticipated dany dragons returning to conquer westeros and the fight with
but she only has two chapters so if you a arya fan go ahead and read her chapters they not
first becomes slow and tedious then bursts into fireworks the show in the last two books have not been worth
off and that was so useless since i am a fan of the targaryens i loved this book recommend the
happened to the main characters the other books followed the surprise of catelyn and then nothing what about sasha lots
without these bloody getting in the lucas should make the screen version he does know how to write three dimensional
would rate this at but only is available after the letdown of a cok this is a bit of a
the series were eagerly waiting for it therefore the first question is it worth the wait for me it is
is move the main characters into position for a really conclusion jon dany tyrion arya bran even better it does
the book was easy to purchase and download i a fan of the game of thrones series so it no
live among the wildings a feast for crows was a disappointment after the mastery shown in thrones clash and storm
was enjoying the journey so martin painted himself into some writerly corners big deal it a complicated world he has
journey so martin painted himself into some big writerly corners deal it a complicated world he has created and i
as you heard and then some adod drags on a slow in the middle parts as much of the story
bad things do happen in the westeros am not a and sorcery reader but boy am i hooked i not
the next and multiple characters being involved in many different events even the smallest things they do can turn out
smallest things they do can turn out to have a effect on the entire story it s quite fascinating how
this goes on forever so the reader is expecting some event and huge climax as one would expect but no
by stannis and then it over with no details wow twist with the onion knight he dead he not dead
up book what more can i say i am a fan i love the book i ca wait for the
in this series a great deal i am generally not on fiction but i could not resist reading the entire
possible before fans burned bantam down and this is a book without including maps the appendix and several author notes
in the series a feast for crows was a pretty disappointment crows lacked many of the major characters that fans
it is what it is when a story becomes so that you ca keep up with it you the reader
the other reviewers are correct that there are so many events in this book as in the first three frankly
is more otherwise i guess everyone just dies i a fan of this series this book is very good it
just wish it was coming out sooner this is a complex world martin has created with lots of intrigue and
his desire to flesh out a world with characters both and small wandered off into the woods and is striving
mother of dragons i bought the hardback and it is the song of ice and fire is a great series
to for him and vouch for the girl identity a wedding is held at winterfell and theon through plots and
of ice and fire book the storyline was just too apparently for a single book a rationale i thought reasonable
is not written and the story is never finished no deal but if the tale is told i will read
i hope the next comes out soon very soon a thanks to george martin thanks for being awesome the continuation
second line interests you buy it otherwise give it a miss everything that needed to be said in the storyline
waited so long for this volume but a work this requires time that being said i ca wait for the
and for as much money as as a proof how money matters look at a shameful review from los angeles
fantasy stories it seems natural to me that after some battles and the deaths and defeats of many major characters
that to his audience with artistry this is a great world with great big characters and with this installment martin
with artistry this is a great big world with great characters and with this installment martin proves again that his
and with this installment martin proves again that his great series has plenty of i did read this one slower
the rambling make sense some people i know have a problem with that style of writing and have a hard
him the other people yes there are more it a book the downside is that when a chapter ends we
of and the ones you think will do something really do not one like the title says disappointing this morning
new characters mixed in with the old i not as a fan of some of the newer characters so that
i did not finish enough already wow i am a grrm fan and i waited years for this first of
will never read any more of his garbage i a fan of good guys getting the beautiful girl and really
that was more important than jumping on to the next issue in the book it called development and in a
for my mom for her birthday as she is a game of thrones fan and she was really happy to
way the story ends is simply insulting i am a fan of martin but its simply hack writing to have
just read book hoping for some conclusions or directions a book and nothing really happens of consequence other than the
keep track of everything and everyone especially with such a gap from the last book at the end of listening
story is all over the place still it has more moments than book four so i give it four stars
to his historic rainbow of interconnected plots dance is as and bold as the preceding novels it dark heavy and
weeks and weeks and it turns out to be a aug spoiler really jon is dead wtf could you have
on doing what right that got him killed too not on writing reviews this is the second best book in
anything but it is at turns thrilling and terrifying a complicated behemoth of a book full of unexpected surprises and
is resolved this is not surprising for a series as and ambitious as a song of ice and fire but
of new pov there must be some point right a payday to come well sad to say that is not
in anyway read anything on the maps this is a disappointment i am enjoying this adventure and ca wait for
happens complain i strongly disagree with that there are no battles or sword fights true if that what you mean
second half when the time lines come back together my complaint is that all of the characters who you read
for the tv series so like most here i a grrm fan we all loved books feast left us a
and crows real magic dudes who love talking about how their members are and to top it all off you
was always some kind of payoff in the end a battle a major magical undertaking something here we get squat
feeling so i try to keep this review am a grrm fan and i read all of the fire ice
and then thought that it as i said i a grrm fan and i buy his next book too but
cuz you getting a close up of a wheel spinning deal same with the playback on i buy it if
win any race without trying on casual difficulty then lose time on medium then i found the custom difficulty settings
almost with for fritz fritz was about and is a improvement over fritz for analysis by improvement i mean that
is a solid recreation of the sport and this summer sporting event but it lacking spark and feels a little
and ssx tricky the games that started the ea sports brand buckle up your bindings as a returning veteran or
playing mario kart and all the other classics on a screen tv i could not be happier with this product
buy this game you wo be disappointed if you love boats or just boats in general and love being out
extremely easy silicone case over my controller i noticed a difference the a b x and y buttons were noticeably
controller very grippy so sweaty hands is no longer a issue i have of them over all black and one
will catch it not really a deal breaker or a deal or anything since i plan on cutting it off
these for a present i know she will love them waste of money not worth the effort to even send
my old dsixl and somehow lost the inner pen the pen long since gone this clicks in a little more
and take off it makes the controller feel a little bigger and somewhat heavier if you considering buying this product
is also just as slick so socks are still a if the players value their limbs and personal you familiar
states and that is a lot of space even the games usually take up maybe and a little change sometimes
try it for the wii though this is a pretty memory card and has quite of bit of space on
do know about the massage effect since the are that but it does keep the board in place and your
said lighter for a day but it really is a weight difference to all the time the wii fit sleeve
to find the right case for my psp nothing too and bulky and something that would have a snug fit
shielding seems to slip around the plug head not a deal but could lead to eventual short when i saw
simple yet so obvious a necessity given how short the n made their controller cords buy them now and heal
just as fun as the day it came out a must have if you ca get the wireless format to
and they accomplished what i bought them for i have screen tv and the rooms i use for these have
budget so i just stick with a wired controller no deal the gamecube controller wire is length has always been
the game looks like garbage compared to the real thing surprise emulation messes up a game do yourself a favor
with my cousin i thought it was not a very deal but it whent from to very fun and challenging
game like me x men vs street fighter was a hit in the arcades everybody said that game was the
have a detrimental effect on the already bad arcade version selling point was that you picked two characters and could
i know it a fact that this game was so you had to swap discs that the only reason i
version of hide and seek because the maps are so one thing i like about playing it with bots is
and it better than project titan if you got a tv then you are lucky and you can fully this
platform are four characters to choose from two chicks a giant and the handsome one they each have their own
never known that it existed at all thanks to the a for that you enjoy this band you will delight
the emotions its amazing graphics you can view on a resolution better textures and stuff more crisp than the psone
get more intense you really get the feel that something much bigger than even all these characters is building up
buy game for all adventure seakers my friend is a fan of playing video games that are hard to find
the suave of sixties beat culture and the style of is a sensory explosion somewhat courageously it does attempt to
the right questions on your own might be this a game with lots of scenes and lots of people to
gamer magazine greatest game ever made i was never a fan of the shooter fps genre but after giving a
say fantastic story fantastic story telling fantastic pace said is in this game as well the controls are phenomanal sp
best game i ever played and i not even a fan of such games to begin with but i am
frustration i thought this game would be great i a fan but it was really boring it was just a
creators thought a gamer might try when i shot the boss i thought the quot quot sequence was hilarious it
even attempt to buy this game however if your a fan you might like this in this game you play
and available modes the tracks offer beautiful scenery sometimes very jumps jumping over cars and a lot tricks and the
you a new he only in some worlds in a shaman skull bring him mumbo tokens and he will change
fanboy so do even go there but rare took a all over this series with the newer games on microsoft
lair key word being this one location is just so but perfectly balanced with the ease of traversing that it
to one of the game nine worlds which are all diverse and have a lot of stuff to find you
in his glory days once again crash bandicoot takes a step up to greatness crash bandicoot warped was fantastic it
of secret levels for the series new bosses including a boss and a new playable character these things are what
fantastically detailed game that mixes genres and characters into a story that erupts with fabulous enjoyment in short buy it
live without my crash bandicoot any longer d i a crash fan and got this game the christmas it came
as oppose to we see the evil who is the boss of dr cortex and we see that crash is
did come with a case though however this is a deal this is an awesome game the game was shipped
well most of the time anyways and if you a fan of james bond you will really enjoy this game
it time for gamers who bought the last of the n cartridge systems to see if their investment was a
installment into the tired and outdated shooter game genre the suprise is that it is so much more than a
rare actualy managed to compress a game that was too for the into this game somehow and it suprises me
never feeling into it the quad split screen was a nuisance thank goodness for online play today the games today
the last one alive items in the game play a part some will boost your speed while some are used
from falling so it a challenge and i like the egg the one thing that drives me crazy is the
begining for activision you can play a guy with a stick or a girl with a sword you have to
for and i be done i was never a really fan of and star wars just was my thing i
case i already knew that so it cool so no deal was a little dirty but hey it used so
am i roaming through temple rooms that are way too for their own good are high ceilings and deep pits
now give me a break guys the rooms are so they basically have no life whatever instead of being loaded
but even then dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being it more
they make red bubble is basically the same thing as skulltula but on fire and are boring the let out
mask i loved the trading mini game to get the goron i finished this game i almost felt as though
excessive length its mazes and the sad ending as the prize afterward the fun factor was reduced and at times
confusing but fun at the same time the world is and you are always finding new characters and lands as
and cramped kokiri forest which actually used to seem so onto the your first of hyrule feild the sun will
ocarina of time got all the heart pieces all the po all the masks and thought the chickens were an
type frame to the gameplay frame that not really a deal though the organization of buttons and their respective functions
will remember tunes of kakariko village and zelda lullaby a plus is that all the sound effects from previous zelda
week it a good deal and is worth the money time it looks great i have to wait until i
characters in the game too some are cool some are and some are the the legend of zelda ocarina of
what have you accomplished you beat a friggin video game friggin deal go out and get a life my seriously
by doing so you will open the way to ganon bad what do we have in zelda you go and
my favorite places to go to i am a very zelda fan if you liked majora mask you like the

of total immersion do get me wrong i am a tr fan i have every single game but sucks big

this game is so much fun i always been a fan of mario since the beginning the graphics are great

of strange luigi was in the game but not that of a is well loved and remembered but it is
it too like it takes too long to make a city and sims complain tooooo much but it all good
who cares it dosent do jack sucks i was a fan of sim city and sim city i am not
can say is that i know this game is a compromise to the original intentions of the designers if you
a fan otherwise i strongly recommend skipping it i a castlevania fan and i feel that this game does not
good up the path is a straight line with a monster at the end it was totally boring an not
problem as is the camera however this is not a surprise for it is the first time the series of
the realism since after all you moving a dragon a creature like a dragon wo move forward right away then
who created the music in this game also played a part in creating those police songs the music in spyro
height and speed i need to reach the egg but deal this game is how i remember spyro and brings
destroy a cult stop the spanish pirates and fight a boss with a bigger sword of course there are those
it less scary sorry you always be second to your wan na pick it up and prove me wrong it
was i the first re was little more than a laughable joke thanks to the ridiculously horrible voice acting that
classic scare resident evil showcases just why the series became and why resident evil is the leader of the genre
game it is the best resident evil game so far improvement from resident evil ready for halloween kiddies late september
city searching for clues as to the of her missing brother chris a member of the raccoon city police department
we be without claire leon and ada they are a part of what makes the resident evil series without them
no hunter which just not fun and unlike there no thing you i first owned this game when it first
the third were new monsters in this game like the alligator in the sewers the lickers plant zombies that spat
ctr and just bought the wrath of cortex i a crash lover but the first one my favorite it challenging
never even had to think for a debut game a debut considering all the advertisements on tv commercials sony would
among platformers as perfect timing and skill do play a part in beating this for it time it was a
at least coco has the ability to speak unlike her voice acting changed dramatically as well and for the better
thier is so much trial and error like in the pro is the graphics are amazing for the the crash
na need a memory card because this game is fairly unless you a really hardcore game then you wo need
the way not to mention you have to hit the headed clown times in a row before he gets to
the way with some help of me we are not gamers but like jump n run please be aware of
double barrel shotgun rotary cannon rocket launcher plasma rifle the gun the game itself was in ok condition and the
experienced many doom ports and most of them were failures failures but before i go into the review i tell
the first one great nostalgia gift this game was a favorite in my house people who complained about the hard
rocks on or blowing up little bouncing orange creatures with eyes and basically small dragons pole position ii is the
graphics have improved it is also very scary like the snake boss which scared the hell out of me still
at the completely wrong times but when there is a monster coming they just talk quot wow its a monster
you would find on the other games which is a downfall well not really but still it can still be
today standards it still worth checking out if you a fan of the series and want to see how the
action games i rented this game because i am a tm fan i tell ya this game is pretty old
at and i purchased three of the best putting a smile on my son face twisted metal is the best
exist in the entire world sure beats having a million and bulky wwe games out there that have no major
the mario brothers industry for the nintendo it became so that every single thing had to be topped off to
puzzle portion and tons of side games i not a fan of the show but i do recognize when a
graphics poor sloppy ugly and generally funny looking gameplay a fat because the game is not fun all you can
to figure out this game terrible move configuration replay another fat nothing great here at all because of it complicated
fun it was good cast of characters fun gameplay and open stages one of the best things about the game
in this game the stages on each level where quite and hard to complete it is highly unique and addictive
that this game can be played on our which a shock for both of us since none of our games
is your game every character is crucial in a way and small to the telling of a story that takes
load times than a first generation cd console hence a reason for nintendo decision to go with the those of
the top acts as the cover this is not a deal at all and does not affect performance but it
the other one cuts in right away not a very deal but it wears on after content i for one
this game cause it hard as hell if you a akuma fan the game started to begin but once you
many actions going on at once you will need a tv if i spend bucks on something that gives me
an thinking experience but rather for those who like thrills thumbs up one of the best star wars games around
has some pretty good graphics with tons of lands with enough levels this game will keep you occupied for hours
into the second level you get to walk bowwow the chain chomp that lives next to marin and tarin he
game boy color for the holidays last year i a so this gift was that nuts but i still wondered
should be without it it all ways pauses its a waste of money i suggest not to get this because
card series followed pikachu dolls were everywhere i was a fan of this fad and i was only in the
the series this is still a classic i not a fan of rpg style games but this is the easiest
its sooooooo much better than ruby version ruby is a you want a good starting pokemon choose charmander even though
thanks you i love pokemon games and fun games so fans pokemon that why i buy them you know thanks
the game in a hour they either cheated found a glitch or both or else their exaggerating but the only
your game every once in a while then its no also a lot of the one star reviews kept saying

this game youll be glad you youre not already a smash fan youll become one in this game there are
really makes it less fair that you can use a baseball bat or a lightsaber or a to help you
that the console is too small for me i have fingers so it hard for a grown up kid a
almost every model of gameboy nintendo had put out the gray one i barely remember as mine was stolen by
gameboy was a mess all dirty and scuffs all over let down wanted to return and could as a gift
and too small which causes a problem for people with hands like have games harry and the baseball kong hey
anybody the size of the body makes it good for and small hands would recommend to new and vets to
that was most likely from the previous owner not a deal it came with full aa batteries and the game
nintendo ds an original gba a gbc and the first hulk game boy i take a minute bus to work
the game i was looking for the screen not being enough it was a lot of fun and there are
game is still a blast yes people this game sucks time this game came with the original nintendo system back
good and bad the good is that the sprites are and everything feels highly genuine the bad is that it
classic songs to these new ones but that not too of a who says this game has no depth simply
lively announcer of and reminiscent of a fight with a cigar but always entertaining the game is the best looking
i got mine for i believe it depends on how of a street fighter fan you are i mean if
th adn trigger very good for such a low price companies should pay found it at cnet as a highly
this really was impressive basically this product was a very disappointment it may look really nice but there is no
really do get good quality plus those other controllers are and they get in the way anyway i recommend this
coded with things like triangle square ect i remember having problems remembering which was which and had to keep glancing
object and social interaction is all part of one great incredibly fluid dynamic puzzle it really a strategy game at
the world you travel through is well designed and pretty as a whole you wo find a bad or boring
more than ten years before i sold it at a mistake these are a great piece to make those of
different worlds and marveling at the genius who has a enough imagination to come up with things like this what
best game in the adventure genre the world is very and the graphics are substantially better than the original myst
because i read the cheat book do tell the one difference between this and myst i say is that while
face it this game subject to change i am a multiplayer person every time i go to a used game
game it a downright abomination to the world and a slap to the face of anybody who was seriously into
those who have played it yet and you are a final fantasy lover i suggest you play this one as
into the game colorful language sexual references etc definitely your brother kind of rpg while some may dispute its overrated
times this game is a drag the graphics are a drawback of this game they arent flat and easy to
didnt take the time to make characters lets make a black man a red lion a jumbo puff a big
big black man a red lion a jumbo puff a girl etc summons are ok but some look lame almost
of them i was really little then and not a fan of games really my snes broke anyways i had
should stress that these problems are going to be too if you do want them to be these are things
made it broke ground that developers feared first true epic budget rpg with cut scene cgi low to zero loading
overall quality and fun though i have other personal favorites shout out for ogre battle i can not argue that
nothing other than graphics i want a story music a world an airship love hate death going to space going
the jump in quality between vii and viii was pretty there are great worlds for you to roam with a
you tend to forget small things that end up becoming things later in the if you were going to by
hours to an outdated rpg i mean there is a jump in visual graphics from to that is very obvious
help but care about what happens next which is a kudos to the writers at squaresoft no squareenix they really
the undeniable peak of an already legendary series it a part of the reason sony nintendo and ultimately won the
his shoulders at ever question thats asked of him that sword he uses sucks too i liked the from squall
playing ff it that good people the storyline is a plus final fantasy games always have good storylines but even
on playstation the graphics are very ugly they look like balloon faced cartoons thier hands are bubbles and they had
the postal guy forcing it into the mailbox but no deal coz the game works the sellers fault of course
of the game is traveling around the world chasing the bad while avoiding or fighting the other big bad and
not stand sitting in one place without some kind of nuclear explosion happening ever three fantasy vii storyline is so
the game once you get off the train with that guy your with this huge city you in is defiantly
i guess acceptable the blurry the through walls thing those anime eyes overall it seems like the makers of this
final fantasy titles i never really cried but when the plot twist at the end of cd occurs i still
game the characters are all cartoony and super deformed with heads and poorly rendered might i add and with little
quot you may call it but in reality its a brown i am giving it one star cuz the music
another deeper into the future look we all heard about flashy this game needs is a bigger my favorit charecter
i had chores to do any way now to the far as gameplay goes this game gets the gold medal
the odin from the one from is ugly aeris dies deal she sucked anyway i wish i couldve killed cloud
depressed for a few days lol aeris cant be resurrected deal i hate storys that can never stand a bit
meteor fire ball i am sure you can imagine the explosion noise that gargantuan rock lets out when you use
life if you do then i guess you not as of a loser you thought you were now huh so
look like stuffed animals with no mouth or noses just eyes the hands and legs are attached to the body
to the history of video games it was the first hyped rpg for the sony playstation system even though it
their moving development the multitude of characters are also a plus everyone from the folk like and marlene all the
end of the game where everything comes together and the twist is revealed that was basically i give it stars
hours to an outdated rpg i mean there is a jump in visual graphics from to that is very obvious
of a i wish santa would have given me a lump of coal instead the character design is plot is
the legend of zelda twilight princess diablo ii wow not wow player anymore but it hard not to see its
fantasy vii is the game which made the jrpg genre in the west and eleven years later it still ranks
decade later but with so much praise there is a chance for most of the acclaim for this entry in
things the characters incredible number and variety of weapons those ass monsters called the weapons its all so sick it
i am today i feel well it definitely had a part in it that for sure graphics look bad on
does cid you may not get this if you are for final fantasy games the limit breaks are cool during
you wrong by a long shot cloud is an with problems with his hair and if you think that games
in your life start with this one it a real love some of these other reviews i glad i not
the terrorist organization known as avalanche ran by barrett a black man with a for a hand his second in
were simply very much plot starts with you fighting a evil corporation that practically controls the world but it is
least good of all rpg games the graphics was a jump from the old platform and actually we have to
one thing i did like however and this is kinda is the main protaganist cloud strife he just plain unlikeable
idea compare the cinematic graphics form to there is a leap and improvement in and from to and of course
final fantasies and even the weaknesses graphics but not a deal to people not too concerned with that like me
the graphics are fantastic better than anything on or only complaint is more with the awkwardness of the dreamcast control
control than with the game controls themselves a little too for someone used to the smaller playstation controllers other than
he ai playin games no more i f your a resident evil fan this is the game for you even
kill all the baddies and finally kill one of the bosses from the game claire and chris are standards and
room as a a fire or any of the other items you find and have to carry in this game
a few creepy environments that come to mind like alfred dark house on the hill that is a mix of
around your opponent with ease jumping does not play a part in this game in fact you barely use it
showed the dreamcast could be a major competitor being a fan of the arcade version i must say for the
kinda like tekken only with swords and knives and a fan of all fighting games tekken my favorite so i
is a really amazing game and i not even that of a fan of fighting graphics moves settings and so
is awesome i love it and not not really a fighting game freak is there a way to play as
absolutely nothing furthermore the shoulder buttons on the quantum are and take a long time to push your timing on
so he could make his system work on his new tv so i got myself another set we are both
most golf games i played focused more on having a name tiger woods than fun but nes open was great
in ring mode speed mode or in mode is the one you start with a variety of nintendo characters to
game is of my favorites and it all fits into fat trust me what else is their ask i used
becomes more and more interesting as you that a very however do not buy this game for the playstation the
to wwf attitude is the game has all of the time superstars in the world wrestling federation stone cold steve
game for the create a mode you can make like fat and have them fight a skinny white jobber so
than face several boss charactors at obvious areas nemisis the bad boss of this game will literally chase you throughout
just hang in there with me i was always a resident evil fan from the first game where you see
way some of you may remember from well there a similarity between the two their both huge mutant zombies that
modified lab monsters from as well as killer and some nasty worms you wo find at your local bait shop
series let me just say that i have been a fan of the series since the first one arrived on
the hospital going and the end when raccoon goes a plus is when you unlock the unlimited magnum and the
resident evil is that it doesnt have enough bosses or enemies even though you do fight nemesis a lot and
to which course of action you will take in certain evil seems very unique from the other re games and
have added the police departement in it was really a waste of time the waste factory left you with a
may expect the quot scare quot while playing on a screen with surround sound the volume almost reverberating the room
never finished the game back then and it was a pain finishing it this time around a lot of backtracking
dont want them while racing to a for example a race against time with tense dramatic music the game tosses
to solve to advance another time you have to solve puzzles in the span of minnutes where you have to
i suggest you get the guide as it is a help in difficult areas and play playstation dino crisis is
pac family is gearing up for it they preparing a party but suddenly guess who shows up and kidnaps them
from way back and really enjoyed this game it quite with most levels taking quite some time to complete there
other one look like crap my playstation library certainly is but i know for a fact that you need this
this is the game boy color we talking about the difference between the game boy color and arcade versions is
get rid of the bad guys you do get that diamond bonus i bought this game thinking it was what
the system the other was star wars episode podracer very wrestling fan and loved learning how to execute the moves
the game is because you do go through a very world with many areas with hardly any load time but
row and suddenly your team is unstoppable it take a chunk of fun out of the two player mode as
and get it but if your a person like a zelda fan like me get something else youd be useing
friends and i are hooked i have always been a zelda fan but sorry this is way better with zelda
full of your character victims big fun if you like or causing lots of destruction if your looking for a
it gives me something i love it big i have hands like maybe most people out there and it fits
it fits me well though the controller may look pretty it actually not all that big its maybe the size
controller may look pretty big it actually not all that its maybe the size of a gamecube controller and a
also a huge sega fan and needed the newest system time it was september had to drive miles to the
console on the market everybody is talking about the quot quot gamecube but they seem to forget that dreamcast is
you start a game unfortunately the dreamcast was not a seller but is does pack quite a punch for its
most of these games online via seganet which is a up a copy of soul calibur or resident evil code
has the most confortable controller i ever used good for or small hands and now that sega is out of
that the internet play is virtually flawless i a pretty gamer so i also be buying the later this month
sonic adventure great games but now that microsoft has there awsome xbox and sony dvd playing computer everybody is swallowed
it alot it a great system but there are two problems the controls for it are very awkward and they
a dvd player people say that the controller is too that is just another excuse for the to be better
is about the same or equal to the i a fan of the console i was going to buy one
it time for sega to kick back in to the game industry let me start off by saying i am
or i almost broke down and purchased one of the but decided to save my money and go with the
pay for one xbox or the controller while it is is easy to if you do have the money to
dreamcast i had owned just the ps one i a sports game player and i simply could turn down the
memory pack either the one with a screen or the storage i have both u can use the one with
the you want a the best console and have a wad of cash then the xbox is the best one
owner ever since this console came out here comes the with a dvd player in it but what if the
breaks then both are useless get my point that is marketing device that there is a dvd player dreamcast is
a lot smaller than i expected the playstation was pretty until they released a smaller version which is still bigger
the dreamcast was and very original a definite for any gamer or collector it is a shame that the best
a while they will only be making games for the systems but do worry too much there are still tons
my year way if he breaks it it is no is a reason went belly up it is an inferior
is feeding to the public making something that not a deal seem like the greatest thing that ever happened to
one and how i do love it it has a games selection with all sorts of games for a wide
battery life is just fine the controller ports are another plus because me my girlfriend and two can play all
glimpse of from dreamcast and boy did it make a difference i got myself a dreamcast and never turned back
a chance on a scale of i would give a people think that these new systems are so cool on
that tagline they used while i never been a really fan of sega they made some of history greatest games
triggers in the perfect places which provides fast response another plus is that the dreamcast has controller ports playing with
complaint is the controller shape is a little wonky too and i have big hands like the and the first
shape is a little wonky too big and i have hands like the and the first xbox other than that
sony and nintendo not to mention microsoft were just too and their advertising too effective and let not forget one
nintendo gameplay most of playstations games are nothing but a cinematic heap and minutes of gameplay with that said i
the parts available to go online for the are no deal when it comes included with the sega x box
dreamcast or gamecube or have only tried out games at stores the dreamcast also has a better game choice theres
new game came out in japan but its got a fan base still many people i know love the dreamcast
they do make larger off brand ones if its a concern the first thing i noticed about the dreamcast controller
lot of people thought that this controller was way to and that it wasnt good but me i thought differently
a pretty unique controller in its own form kind of yes it is but it still has a great feel
the rf switch this one is the perfect one not and not to little but just perfect fast shipping well
darkstone is a great choice here in australia we pay money for games this one cost us and it was
game lovers from way back but this one was a disappointment the fact that its a diablo clone was actually
of the dungeon creatures with my thief i not a fan of the amp d game but this game is
d game but this game is really neat the one advantage of this game over diablo is the ability to
if you keep up with saves its not really that of a deal i do warn you that this game
left out of the world council which can be a disadvantage later on there are some minor bugs so be
colonel marines are both brittle and slow but they have weaponry chain gun with rounds anyone also the chain gun
i didnt have a problem with it new characters too amy and i think everybody who owns a dreamcast should
the dreamcast with his buds tails amy rose gamma and the cat this is a great game and anyone should
sonic are to play with named sonic tails knuckles amy and gamma eggman made monster named chaos when chaos get
is red very cool amy sonic pink quot girlfriend quot a purple big cat that to get fish and a
cool amy sonic pink quot girlfriend quot big a purple cat that to get fish and a red robot sorry
the original yeah there are some flaws but they are and should stop you from buying the game i would
quot now would it i say his because i a knuckles fan and was kinda disapointed at how quickly i
can play as five other characters tails amy knuckles and you ca just pick whoever you want you have to
a weapon which is at least a little interesting as you have to fish to find your friend froggy this
cool he shoots things adding time to the clock and the cat cruises and fishes the whole finale is incredible
of this awesome game sonic adventure was and is so and so grand that i find it hard to write
exploratory puzzle racing and fighting game all rolled into one adventure whew if there ever was a game that gave
might have it that i hate the fishing levels with the cat it hard as hell to me sonic adventure
duh tails and knuckles the other three are amy rose the cat and gamma if any of you like fishing
and gamma if any of you like fishing play as and then there are the they focus on making the
but is chased back to the ship by froggy owner the cat after his crash tails finds another emerald and
eggman meanwhile knuckles steals back the six chaos emeralds and uses the tornado ii they both flee from the ship
get powerups and upgrades for sonic tails knuckles amy gamma the u played all the story u unlock final story
adventure an exciting breathless astounding game as sonic tails amy gamma each character must stop the evil that threatens an
hammer it gets old very save the worst for last the cat his levels are just a fishing there nothing
a treasure hunt knuckles or spend all your time fishing the cat each of these elements is entertaining in its
the action levels are great so maybe robotnik has a flying ship called the egg carrier so what wrong with
enough added to make it feel like more than a scenery iii shifts the scene to the pacific northwest which
versions such as interactive instrumentation available on the beechjet one problem is that the approach light systems are a feature
download to fix this particular problem so its not that of a i a adventure game player and i avoid
loved this is a must buy i am not a fan but like combines a great story with an incredibly
that is being demanded on amazon i always been a fan of the genre in books and film when i
bigger bass put up better fights and in practice mode bags are easy to obtain for the first or so
challenging so you feel great when you finally catch the and about not being able to move around the lake
is also very realistic because you can easily lose the one if you play the fish wrong you have to
the world is an and running it in for a while your opponet is left in the dust of course
is perfect and everything has it flaws one of the things is how ugly the look especially when the camera
and it was loads of fun i am not a football person but this game has sparked my interested i
which are confusing and they make typos that make a difference such as how to turn it on and trying
who loves to play pokemon but this product was a dissapointment at first the gameshark did work and when it
any country this way you can give the computer a advantage and make the game much more difficult to this
but hasbro hates to lose after that yes they cheat time you end up deleting amp reloading constantly just to
is sweet you got ta have it i was a fan of rook witch was the big reason i got
i was a big fan of rook witch was the reason i got this but now i play it every
review the writer stated that the shift key had a disadvantage over the other two players i find this totally
another company decides to make one if you are a fan of jeopardy then i would buy it but if
but no luck there this was going to be our screen game guess not very happy with game seller was
has a light magnifier stereo speakers and a joystick and buttons the down part is with game boy camera you
floppy disks that came with mine were bad not a deal considering the usefulness of the product i love civilization
for that one game though but overall it is a waste of your money time and effort the gameshark is
off at extreme long range besides graphics changes the two changes are a nice zooming to make those shots easier
because while it in theory looks fine it has a black which blocks your view of most of your screen
and your actions however small play a part in the picture as you soar over the battlefield you watch explosions
out of the way and not to mention it as as your face no the basic snes controller does have
however in that the big m maven always knows those long words that you amp i would never even consider
fix the crash problem you still stuck needing a pretty chunk of free hard disk space to play the game
diffrent scenarios from the wars and expansion a must for risk fans my husband had risk for his computer for
take the disc out but only temporarily so it no deal great game this is a great game the custom
to worry about having the disc i never been a fan of games until i saw my husband playing this
coffe and hat stalls i am normally not a real fan of sim type games so i waited a while
a mediocre coaster can get very tedious and expensive one coaster will chew up all of your cash and if
though they are expensive do build your water ride too as you typically only have boats and the lines get
that in order to unlock further maps one has other problem with this game from my perspective is the poor
successful at the game appealing to the customers is a challenge this game is so addictive you get to design
people like your park the game is worth the money time it was missing the cd and the missing cd
it did come with a manual but that not that of a deal since you can find instructions for the
weird things until i shut the other programs off no game itself is very well done tons of fun i
your environment and you can build big and i mean the levels are well laid out with different scenarios you
as the designer maker and manager of your own however it is the missions that you have to try and
were going up to get ready to go down a drop you could hear the belts as they were going
with the than the original joystick which is always a gripe of mine just make sure to experiment with which
games and stuff like that this golden controller is too bulky and if this did happen to yours the control
i know that own these the z button is a problem after the week or so that i said it
pick out about gamepads or joysticks you can buy popular brand names found in almost every computer store which my
and then cycle through all of the blocks slowly no deal let it do it thing and then follow the
this was a period in gaming when the engine was mostly because from a programmer standpoint you could do things
the fool with the chicken it also developed a pretty community with many new custom maps always being created leading
whole time sniping at enemy fighters or helping engage the capital ships there different options for your ships to maneuver
well to being by thugs in white armor and great metal things with the control interface does get points for
super star destroyer for the uninformed a ssd is a ship that you should go near heck it so bad
minor criticisms the cutscenes do seem very also the quot finale quot against the death star seems to just have
more than and sound are the date unfortunately being the news is that you can now those enemies or craft
a lack of a save option but that is that of a problem because these are huge frustrating levels while
playing the game every night after work i am a fan of myst and this is not myst myst wears
and anyone who craves action and seeks adventure i had worries about this game i used to play the old
to be doing second some of the are way too the third and biggest flaw is that the last levels
and i like these type of games i also a fan of shoot em up games like unreal tournament and
see how it runs your old games before making the buy out of the ps games i own only ever
realistic overheats in like min takes forever to load too of a price for what its really worth only two
time so they were used to the cartridges which were and bulky and somewhat annoying it has two memory card
it pretty fun draw back is that you need a computer sure its fun its exciting for about minutes you
this game when it first came out i am a fan of roller coaster type games but this game does
were too low and should raise prices prices was a factor in the game which made it confusing the graphics
you already have rollercoaster tycoon because it will disapoint you time do take your money and waste it buy a
with more terrain sand traps and water wholes was a step over the two less graphically enhanced courses offered in
aspect would make it more interesting but i not a fan of multiplayer at any rate if you never played
i finally picked it up just to see what the deal game is like software crack i have had it
my uncle and friend both informed me that even the guy diablo was easy to don r run away yet
missions just get boring and you just going through this dungeon full of skeletons i know it may sound but
of getting used to before you able to tackle the boys tribes is a great game i was extremely happy
both perfectly balanced while in many ways totally is a matter in starcraft each species has their own pros and
most detailed storylines in a game ever and i a rpg fan so i can know with many emotional moments
it graphics are the variety of units and structures is the gameplay is smooth and efficient the game has great
losses in the meantime the protoss have also become a pain in the bleep the protoss seem bent on destroying
actually at war with the protoss and terran over a misunderstanding the zerg only live to serve the cerebrate to
on islands you method of winning is use aircraft use aircraft use aircraft and land some troops use aircraft with
flesh you see no one does it better than the guy craft is the most addictive game to date i
master still the game allows players to just build up powerful units and to victory this is a good rts
of a strategy fan i have played them all the hits and the only one any good is the command
very each race has its corresponding strengths and weaknesses quot deal quot you may be saying quot every strategy game
and names to stuff like quot bring a here create robot and display text message he the guy car quot
with almost every group of soldiers they can be a these ships fire missle alot of missles at enemy air
for the pc in the last couple years its not on complex graphics or full motion video but the gameplay
of even as a gamer who plays all the new name rts rpg and fps i still say that this
as if you really in the events that unfold before story of the game features alien invasions rescue missions corporate
also features numerous strategic scenarios that do play into the story and shows you how to set up online battles
in my time i played a number of games a number and some have been good while some have been
the expansion good collectors item for people i was never into rts games my friend let me borrow c c
the dominant pick of the and every year it the news of the event blizzard is terrified to make another
half an inch tall or larger for tanks and other units inches nice plus all battles are real time with
console but after coming to korea where starcraft is really gaming i found myself sucked into this whole new world
cinematics ultimately all the story lines tie together into one epic tale of multi species galactic have even tried the
read but they are particularly good anyway so it no loss to not read makes this game so great this
a computer ai note that multiplayer games were not so in the intense thrilling experience that this environment provided still
curse words in it but nothing as bad as the word and the music just gets you ready to fight
out the multiplayer part of the game is like a soap opera many squads and legions with their own types
knowledge what could be better these games are definately a plus while quot jack quot is a good game and
than people can play at a time i was a fan of the ydkj games in the and i was
life yet definately buy this one years ago i was in this game playing team fortress classic its a server
used to kill everything except and the baby the two bosses also ammo is plentiful especially since you dont need
release game of the year in about there and showing numbers in sales records this game is worth your hard
novice gamer alike great work sierra i was not a fan of action games before i bought almost immediately after
for anyone wanting story gameplay replayability and fun in one package do forget the thousands of downloadable levels the rats
what to shoot at or where to go let the man step in he said before trying his luck on
black mesa reseach facility and are working on a very project which goes very wrong warping aliens to the lab
interactions etc add to the ambiance a remarkable job next thing enemy ai this is the first time i have
valve has levels packed right in with this game nice areas with lots of weapons make this game a fun
