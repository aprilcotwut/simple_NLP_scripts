brush dipped in a bucket the squeegy to dry the with does lay flat enough to evenly take the water

much as product highly recommended i purchased my first california duster to use on my new corvette a few years
few corvette owners highly recommended this duster to keep the clean after washing it i was shocked to see the
works to take the layer of dust off of the and renew the shine below most husbands would enjoy this
husbands would enjoy this if they take pride in their i purchased this for my brand new because i am
when i get home in the garage i dust my off and it looks brand new just like i got
use definitely would not buy another one this is a duster or for uncle bald head only works real good
as well what used to take mins to dust the with other types of cloth tis takes me only mins
one of the best car products i have found every owner should have one in their trunk the dirtier it
all i have to do is brush this over the every day for a minute and it maintains the car
the clear coat it works amazingly well on my black and keeps it looking freshly detailed make sure you do
this vendor like the plague i bought my original california duster for my new black truck in when i sold
so happy to have been told about it my little is black which shows every spec of dust it is
able to whip out the duster and go over my and have it sparkling again the spots i can easily
black metallic car and the duster helps to keep my looking new had one of these several years ago and
keep in trunk has an odor if you are a guy like i a car guy you heard about the
odor if you are a car guy like i a guy you heard about the california car duster a billion
back in the late when i bought my first new it worked exactly as advertised and in the intervening years
eliminates the need for or washings and still keep the looking great really the best car duster out there in
without dragging it around i will not make a filthy that has been washed in weeks or months look clean
noticed the red lint that other reviewers have experienced our is dark grey and shows everything robust handle this thing
that it cleans and restores a wax finish to my with very little effort it is a great tool for
car duster is simply stunning i feel like it waxes at mean time and this is a good thing it

it works anyone who has a new car a used or a collector car should have one of these dusters
handle is perfect size and is very sturdy i use products which are used for show cars in other words
surfaces quickly and easily sometimes i get lazy and the duster saves me a full car wash try it i
is an extremely difficult task i spend hours washing my only to wake up the next day and see dust
thing really removes all the dust and helps keep my looking like it was just washed highly recommend this product
produced not so good seeing that i have a black the scratches actually can be seen fairly well i was
dust after a good cleaning and waxing this rids the of the dust that seems to materialize out of thin
clean car with just dust a once over makes the look like it was just washed this is the only
this product back in early when i purchased my new and still use this as my primary duster for the
must get one i am really ocd about keeping my clean so here are my findings after almost year of
minor does not leave behind any permanent scratches on the unlike cheaper dusters that offer similar the handle although a
using this product it left wax streaks all over my which i absolutely could not tolerate then i learned that
it before i put it away does not allow the to dry properly and will cause the brake discs to
is from the dust with this duster it keeps my cleaner and dust and what i found out was if
hollow plastic this thing will last as long as your since the dirtier it gets the better it works well
work as long as you use as suggested dust your and not try to clean heavy dirt with it it
to clean heavy dirt with it it will leave your spotless the original california duster was exactly what my car
lead i like it amazingly wipes off dust keeping your cleaner between washes if you have a black car you
see if it does better thanks i love the ca duster it does a great job keeping the dust of
california duster to me he is fanatical about keeping his totally detailed and this product works so well that he
total of less than minutes to dust off an entire yet the result makes your car look like you just
a garage it quite useful since dust settles on the during the day when you are out and about and
that after washing my car i could only use my cover for a few days before the car got too
i can keep the car dust free and use the cover for much longer which in turn means i do
would not hesitate to recommend one to anyone with a or motorcycle just be aware what it is not made
wash it has been months since i stopped going to wash i saved about if i assume i would pay
five star rating because of past using this first california duster i had recieved as a gift lasted bought a
cheaper but i have had any issues then again my is white and maybe any streaking is harder to see
day over the car and you can forget about most washes only wash the car after it gets gritty this
i live in the south and have to park my outside during the day so during pollen season there was
is a great way to keep the dust off your when i lived in arizona the dust was just awful
just awful i lived out in the country and my always seemed to get caked with dust minutes after i
lot with the windows down this helps a lot my dash and panel is black it is constantly dusty i
all of the dash and instrument panel it keeps my looking nice in little or no time at all excellent
looking nice in little or no time at all excellent duster i leave it in my glove box and it
ordering three dusters red threads were left on my black i followed the instructions and still small red threads i
rubbing a wax candle on the painted surface of your this is what this does leaves a waxy residue when

quick with it great product i use it on my my home window shades and in our rv the big

well they worked they are happy to have a semi now now they just need to move off that dirt
california super duster to go along with my brand new this thing is great especially in the days between a
with the major difference being you get a bright shiny back in under a minute using the super hit the
sure there is no grit on the blade or the also this model has a hard plastic handle which can
is perfect i used one of these at a school wash and was sold the parent that brought the said
without one they are great if you wash you own this is a got ta have dries the car or

sort of leakage after researching the code online i my with gas cleaned my gas cap thoroughly made sure the

it really helps to keep junk from collecting in the especially useful since we have a toddler riding in the
months ago and it was able to start my neighbors immediately and it was not fully charged can you tell
for batteries for a small low current device in my i read the various negative reviews and they sounded as
or something in the underlying electronics this is the first cord i seen with selectable voltage outputs the included array

i have a coby and i purchased the coby universal converter i plugged it in to my car it worked
battery is shot and i only use it in the the thing does work at all does charge does power
a new coby dvd player that did come with a adapter it does charge the dvd battery at all even
electronic devices with their own chargers work fine in my lighter so this thing is a complete bust but not
for my coby dvd player as i lost the original adaptor and this is listed specifically as supporting my model
to take a chance we took it on a long trip this summer and it worked flawlessly the whole trip
it requires and then choose the appropriate setting on your adapter if you randomly choose a setting it will blow

went to a local electronic store and purchased another dc converter rated ma and my wireless camera works fine with
i purchased this item for a dvd player for my it was advertised to have various tips so it would

in perfect conditon product arrived as ic regulated universal dc converter stopped working after one day i think the fuse
use with the coby portable dvd player for a long trip did not work at all the first time we
tried to install this then he realized that with my you need to purchase an additional part i think it
me it took about hours to install it on this taking into consideration i only set it up with the
with it i used it to alternate lighting in my both relays worked out of the box one suggestion i
the to make the install only hooks up the remote starter part of was under the impression that it would
paperwork that came with the starter when he finished the would crank and not stop cranking for a long period
a manual be very careful of wether you leave the in gear i never do so it doesnt bother me
do know what you are doing you can render your useless if you have any doubts by all means have
for my vehicle a isuzu trooper didnt work with the at all i had to buy a new one to
crap works fine if your standing right next to the feels and looks cheap shop around i found a viper
than happy customer that had their very first generation remote starter that i bought off of damark back when there
car is to use the factory transponder to unlock the first well that sucks who wants to do that you
he says the unit is not seeing noise after the starts i tell him that why i connected the tach
the started because this unit kept trying to start the over and over again when i am inside waiting for
and over again when i am inside waiting for the to warm get what you pay for the and are
their website is not so accurate for one of my for avalon the color of the wire for the door
around and it starts put everything back together and the will crank but not start again went throught this exercise
of being an electrician although i had limited experience with electronic wiring with some experience with car audio that said
for splicing into wires using the color code for my available on the website made locating the wires pretty easy
do know if the signal strength is typical of remote starters it works well and is american made while this
new way to go to work in the am warm warm feet love it should have done this a long
it can be integral as it is with this the can then be started remotely because the car detects the
my friend who helped me lot in the installation my is old so it does have central locking system so
regarding my personal level of expertise i am not a audio guy but i do have a good bit of
website and see what relays you would need for your you almost guaranteed to need at least one probably two
starts and stops perfectly as detailed pit stop works fine unlocks and locks as it should and i really like
was a lifesaver for me i keep it in the at all time recharging it from the cigarette lighter so
disappointed over watt there is a great chance that your plus will be lot of devices get lot of devices
understand those are not of the device but of your it electrical system can not perform better i have a
battery dies perfect for carrying and stashing away in your after my seadoo broke down on the lake i decided
item needs i have a trike which i park in parking space with the bike cable wrapped around the adjoining
they will leave it and go on to the next good product this fits perfect on my tacoma great fit
to the side to get to the equipment in the the rack is is small enough that the vehicle plus
this to replace one that bit the dust after two accidents works and looks great highly recommend this purchase it
the floor of our garage since we have one older that leaks oil the mats are very lightweight and tend
this product based on reviews i went out to my when this arrived and it took ten seconds to fix
expect such great results my husband came home saw the and started using it to remove dings on his car
his car it worked i can pretty much pull my with this suction did solve my problem but is because
i a happy man i had two dents in my and now i have one the dent that was successfully
greater than i would have a large dent on my tried to use this dent puller did not do the
but after pulling a decent size dent out of my i was pretty impressed with the suction power i had
like it is very strong i used it for my dent area it sucked and pull out so easily it
i purchased this to fix several small dents on my some on doors some on hood guess what not one
recommend it to anyone who has a dent in their larger than the size of a softball anything smaller would
of my car hitting the side rails at the automatic washing machine i took my car to the auto place
bank and what am i going to do without a for a week as a result i checked online to
hassle it did on the dent i had on my but maybe the dent was bigger than what this tool
a very good product pull a dent out of my without a problem very happy with this item tried to
i get the item i will post it new to maintenance i suppose most people buying these know what they
oem their are sacrifices this by no means fits your it is large enough to cover and protect the only
it fell apart on its own this is a perfect cover for the cost easy to install with elastic bottom
clearly marked as i would have they were size great cover good quality for the price easy to install worked
i answered the questions about my make and model of to find the car cover that would fit although it
did realize how cheap very hard to get on the not close to fitting correctly had to return it this
there are two big grommets on the bottom of the cover on a windy day you can use these to
use these to attach a length of twine under your a length of cheap twine is can not find anything
anything that would scratch my car except those grommets the cover fit my little hyundai elantra ok but it looks
the cover backwards or you are going to secure the cover against wind with the grommets and twine then go
rip i guess it is good if you keep the in the garage not so good if you keep the
in the garage not so good if you keep the outside which is the point of having a car cover
point of having a car cover lame i ordered this cover and it showed up at my house two days
all over the hood this is a fit for the and the cats we are now both happy i have
described although it might be fine and not scratch the i was ready to order or more of these if
garage floor this covered my altima which is a small with no problems whatsoever it did get ripped when i
about two to three days it stays securely on the even in high winds and heavy rain which we had
the ends and is very easy to put on my this thing fits my chrysler but when hooking to bottom
twice a week i suppose i have to wash the cover though not worried about that though d got this
to buy another one different brand the budge lite sedan cover fits great stays put with the elastic great buy
car this is a decent cover for the price the park under a tree and this cover protects the paint
civic although i did not buy through amazon my budge cover started to tear after only years the entire life
just how easy this cover was to apply to our the fit was great the front of the cover is
for garage storage hey you ca go wrong with this cover i got it for my must convertible to keep
leaves had this cover worked properly the paint on my would have been nice i would not recommend this car
made sure that the length was longer than listed the i was putting it on is ft the make sure

we been having it done a great job protecting our just what i paid for and expected i kid you
for and expected i kid you not i am a guy i bought this four months ago for my mercedes
my brother to keep the dust from collecting on his because it normally sits in the barn for long periods

rubber and vinyl round doors bumpers and interior of the looking like knew a little on the pricey side but
garage drying is an extremely important part of washing your and this gets the job done the big sell for
regular chamois and then it works wonders it dries my in about a third of the time compared to regular
this thing really works like a champ and left my shinny i highly recommend this chamois i find it a
car after washing why anyone would continue to dry their with microfiber towels over this is beyond me this is
this is literally the best thing ever and leaves your perfectly streak free if you get dirt on it you
very effectively expect it would be great for washing the too if i did such things i chose this product
but not so once i was done my year old looked like it had just been waxed i did notice
a friend who never returned it so before washing my one day i ran over to autozone and purchased on
run out to find a suitable drying towel and my to remove the dozens of water spots the absorber left
get the larger amounts of water i one of those guys that will wash their car even when rain is
towards the end it removed all remaining water from the this product is very good at absorbing large amounts of
much i say this product is excellent for of the washers out there but for the small amount that want
out there but for the small amount that want their literally spotless i recommend finding a true chamois i purchased
like that the carrying case keeps it neatly in the without wetting other stuff in the cargo area this is
leaving very little to blow dry washing and cleaning my becomes an easy job i can dry the car very
this and the meguiars drying towel and you have your completely dry and streak free in no time this soaks
is exactly what i was looking for it keeps my from getting those stupid spots on it after i wash
going to buy another for my parents dries the whole in looking for something to dry your car off and
the whole car in looking for something to dry your off and leave no this is it i will only
great deal for the price great for after washing your or after a heavy rain this is a very good
just wring it out and start drying again it cuts drying time at least in half maybe more plus the
job at clearing huge amounts of water off of a cleanly and streak extremely disappointed to read some of the
it and wring it in hot water before drying a it seems to open the pores of the those of
it wrong i use the absorber chamois on my classic my boat my truck and my daily driver the latest
this product absorbs all the water left out from a wash and no need to do it again it dries
over years i use it every time i wash my it still works as well as the day i bought
primarily i have used this product to dry off my after washing it it also useful if you working on
it in warm water wrung it out then dried my with it i use a couple of these to dry
carpet but it works really great on a nice waxed lay it out like a sheet on horizontal surface and
and it perfect for when you get out of the wash and need to dry your car off quick so
off the inside of the car or even washing the at home seriously a great buy i had used this
found it to work better this way when drying the lay the absorber out flat unfold it across the surface
end at each corner and drag it slowly across the allowing it to absorb all the water it comes into
exactly as i need tried using mine after washing my i followed the instructions before first time use but it
the old bath towels i was using before made my fuzzy this thing is superior to any chamois i have
it but i have never wash one of these my finish is very good i do have a lot of
the price this is the best tool for drying a on the market imo does scratch washes easily and works
of these at a pop i would be washing my myself i stick with my good clean cotton towels to
first but this thing is great very absorbing dries my in about the time of the chamois when i wash
towel and it looks awesome if i go to a wash i hang the chamois from the carpet hooks on
i do i just use it for drying a good wash is all about the drying and this thing leaves
doesnt do anything just hard to move around on the doesnt absorb any water just useless will not buy another
this may be subjective it does have quite the new smell that you enjoyed when you got your car but
coat i would not use it why any good brand wax will suffice save this product for your unprotected fiberglass
friends and family thank you very much i am a rv detail guy my car and rv must be shining

battery switch this lil guy works great on my race could be happier with it i intend to install this
car to be able to see my grandson in his seat in the only concern is that i have to

much pressure we used this a baby mirror in our the suction cup worked great and the mirror had a
for a much less effective terminal protector if you think and truck battery terminals rust try a boat work with
the move to a pick up truck from a more like vehicle and was having a bit of trouble getting
have used this product on both my wife and my and so far knock on wood there are no scratches
it should be oiled i knew meguiar brand from my use so i picked this up from amazon based on
versatility of this battery i modified the back of my to open up to allow for easier working on the
the market have them in my jet skis motorcycles generator and they just last the time as a reg battery
order but it will air up one of my race drag slicks from psi to psi in about one min
worked flawlessly i have removed oil from not just my but friends and family memebers also not dissapointed with this
well so i guess it is worth the expense my requires that a shield be removed from under the car
to use i have never changed the oil in my using the same filter i changed the oil in minutes

a good visual deterrent for thieves our son parks his in his inner city college parking lot all day so

peterson a few months ago someone decided to take my for a joy ride after going through the process of
my steering wheel will send the bastards to the next that does have one cheaper than the deductable on your
it is one of the best deterrent from would be thieves because it is so visible and take longer to
jerks go on the older cars to steal them the i have now buick came with a metal collar installed
and sadly the locksmith cost me an extra admittedly my did not get stolen during the days i had the
the club is at least i told that a professional thief can cut through it somehow pretty quickly and steal
to car theft it ca hurt and together with a alarm system your vehicle should be as protected as it
wrote about hardening the target if they really want your they going to take it but most likely they just
my parent think this kind of lock will make your safer so i guess you have to believe that if
as a second layer of protection on top of the manufacturer alarm system this is the second club i have
think twice and make it slightly harder to steal the i love my club my car had been broken into
frustrating and nothing was ever really stolen out of my since i been using my club it seems to deter
sturdy high quality steering lock it worked great with my well worth the money i paid i would highly recommend
this product this is a good purchase to protect your works great arrived quickly hopefully a small deterrent for the
expensive honest locksmith a very expensive dishonest locksmith let your get or towed away an with a hacksaw or a
it is exactly what i needed i can warm my up and not worry about it being it is so

happy with the helm needed a lager clock display in this fit the bill perfectly it works great and pretty
daughter who was complaining that the dashboard clock in her stopped working i wanted one that would light up and
buy a vibe to solve your vision at night amazing the clock did not keep time from the day i
x x about by by i bought it for my but it not large enough ordered this clock for a
really out other impacts costing much more lug nuts on could not break loose with breaker bar tire service tightened

i spray some on my wheels before i wash the and it takes off nearly all traces of brake dust
blood engines garage floors driveways tools bbq grills grease filters bikes sports and exercise equipment motorcycles and for diluting simple
purchase of a convenient product to help keep my new clean i used a wipe as directed and it left
they are much cheaper than paying someone to detail your for you i also use the glass cleaning wipes for
helped on long flights it helps a little in my but props me up a little too much head hits
small children in this car all under five having the warm and secure when they go to get in makes
sure i will get one the design tech deluxe remote starter comes with excellent features and a compact remote the
with my wife car i had these installed on every since and you can actually see them stop and turn
around like when removing it to get out of the it only a very minor and occurrence just use your
stores and online to find the perfect blanket for my there is actually not a lot of choices if i
occasionally uses it to keep her legs warm before the heats up but where its really shined is when she
from long work hours so went back out to the and used this to stay warm while during far there
in my household one of them hates getting into the when it cold i have this thing plugged in and
my husband and i battle over the temperature in the nearly every day he gave me this blanket as a
cold night it so happened we had cleaned out the and was in the process of re stocking our bag
clearly stated that this can only be plugged into a cigarette lighter so we had to buy an adapter for
our electric car when we want to turn down the heater and extend the car range a little one power
that a great product my wife uses this in the when we on the road for awhile i like to
my car i originally got one of these for my since then i purchased two more for family and two
very pleased with it she now has one for each i keeps me warm in the car but does not
riding in the car this winter no waiting for the heater to stay warm i received this blanket from my
wrap it around her in the car even though the has heated seats she still likes to put it around
heated seat warms quickly i do have to set the heater so high getting a graceful of hot air really
day now uses it every time she gets in the even if its a minute drive across town if heats
my husband like it cooler then i do in the this keeps me nice and warm even when off i
but enough to freeze up all my windows on my but this icedozer is just crazy i have used so
my buddy had finished his half a job on his this is no joke what a excellent product i have
me over minutes to clear the ice off of my similar storms have came since i received the product both
plenty tall enough and a camry is not a big i was having to lean up against the car just
i would not have been able to get into my or get the windows clear i couldnt warm up my
i cant imagine if i was able to warm my up but besides being encapsulated by ice i dont like
it does not have the reach needed to clear your of multiple inches of i have a for that this
best ice scraper i used on those days when your is encased in a layer of ice this ice scraper
actually for the right side the passenger side of a gave all of a good lock and bought two but
but the inside of the filter was clean and the been running fine through all this a winner in my
easier if i had a full jack to raise the up overhead and could get a bright light in there
your vehicle i have replaced every air filter in every and its always the same power performance sound and economy
same power performance sound and economy i not a big guy by any means but i enjoy a clean sounding
drop down tabs wo produce the right filter for your or truck i ca believe they could be so messed
on gas received product on time but did fit my a second time sent it back to get money amazon
mat it does stay up wires have come thru material trash bins are impossible to find in stores plus this
fall over i bought two of these for my new and they were a perfect fit i like the way
that a trash can would be so useful in a its weighted down with a bean bag to stay put
is a good size for keeping the interior of your clutter free the weighted bottom does a surprisingly good job
sure if you buy the item you have a compact other than that the product is great i grew tired
to your car litter problems i use this on my and it doesnt move or slide around one bit its
and was just taking up too much space in the this item performed better than expected it was everything that
of my car at least fold great for keeping the clean of nicely on the floor of the back use
you want to do just do buy this for a whose visor is more than about wide the straps are
nerves very simple and easy to install will protect my door and also the drywall in the garage it works
was made of a soft material that would protect my doors it is and it does it just as hard
the money this product saves your garage wall and your door edge for those of you that actually use your
and used it to determine some cooling issues with my so i got my husband one for christmas and kept
for keeping groceries from sliding around the back of the folds down flat to about three inches for removal and
definitely heed the directions and put it flat in your before you start setting it up can assemble it in
a nice product to have in the trunk of my to organize packages in a rigid organizer rather than those
something that adds additional flair to the front of the then find something a little cheaper in my opinion however
loved one that you care about him and his classic if you can keep it in the garage if you
car cover extremely weather barrier will continue to purchase covercraft covers this a great cover to prevent dust and dirt
many covers would be the appropriate one to fit my this is the one that came up so i placed
it on my ford instead which is a much taller narrower and shorter than the torino the cover fit the
after the hole was i searched for a medium priced cover the would be useful for outdoor use i picked
florida when i removed the cover the interior of the was a moldy stinking disaster this cover ruined the car
after bouncing back and forth for a few days on covers between brands and custom fit i decided to go
takes care of this business for me he reports the cover is still ike new and there are no new
description stated when ordering is correct the item protects my from and heat the product does what is stated this

with a amp you like to keep this in your you may want to pull it out plug it in
said torque but it ca remove lug bolt in my that why i return spec useless and heavy i bought
brought one downstairs put it in the trunk of my then went back in to get the other drove to
to spray paint for a few days but now my does smell at all i so glad i tried this
review this originally as stars i sprayed this in my which the previous owner had smoked a lot in it
second blast at night when you wo be using the for several hours that gives the product time to clean
is rather noxious and spraying the product while inside the is exactly the most pleasant experience seems to have done
i bought this device trying to eliminate endless number of chargers for cell phones and used in a is good
running my laptop or charging my cell phone from the i bought this for powering a laptop while on the
find a place for it if you car a small but i put it in a found a place for
when we got new phones it meant buying a new charger for each phone well no more we decided to
nice and compact and keeps the laptop running on long trips which we take often it worked great for us
for hotels and area attractions without having to leave the i would highly recommend this xantrex micro inverter never heated
this watt inverter in early june to use in my for powering my netbook while on the road over the
it worked of what it says i used it in to charge my laptop and other items bought in i
worked like a charm i tested it once in a plugging my macbook into while i was using the computer

had the portable power source to easily jump start my what a relief absolutely fabulous for running a blender while
puppy good oh yeah gauge had a holley on the and switched to edelbrock edelbrock worked right out of box
out the whole rear section and ran a straight pipe is very loud sounds great really good buy when couples

it clogged badly enough the improvement might be that your runs now definitely better than many in fit and quality
only filter you will need for the life of your i always used k n filters on every car i
your car i always used k n filters on every i owned and so far i have not been dissapointed
close up the forward the mileage improvement got a new for my wife so i replaced the air filter with
factors for me but being that i can keep my running more efficient by keeping my filter clean every months
